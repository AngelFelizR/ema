#  Local Diagnostics With Ceteris-paribus Profiles {#ceterisParibusWankardu}

## Introduction {#cPLocDiagIntro}

It may happen that, while the global predictive performance of the model is good, model predictions for some observations are very bad. In this chapter, we present two local-diagnostics techniques that can address this issue. IN particulat, we focus on fidelity plots: the plot of CP profiles for nearest neighbors and the local-fidelity plot.

The idea behind fidelity plots is to select a number of observatons ("neighbors") from the validation dataset that are closest to the instance (observation) of interest. Then, for the selected observations, we plot CP profiles and check how stable they are. Additionally, if we know true values of the dependent variable for the selected neighbors, we may add residuals to the plot to evaluate the local fit of the model.

## Intuition {#cPLocDiagIntuition}

One approach to local model diagnostics is to examine how the model behaves for observations from the training dataset. Figure \@ref(fig:profileWith10NN) presents CP profiles for the instance of interest and its 10 nearest neighbors. The profiles are almost parallel and very close to each other. This suggests that model predictions are  stable around the instance of interest, because small changes in the explanatory variables (represented by the nearest neighbors) have not got much influence on the predictions.

```{r profileWith10NN, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(fig:profileWith10NN) Ceteris-paribus profiles for a selected instance (dark violet line) and 10 nearest neighbors (light grey lines) for the `titanic_rf_b6` model. The profiles are almost parallel and close to each other what suggests the stability of the model.", out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/example_cp.png")
```

Once we have selected the nearest neighbors, we can also look closer at the model fit around the point of interest.
Figure \@ref(fig:profileBack2BackHist) presents histograms of residuals for the entire dataset and the selected neighbors. The distribution of residuals for the entire dataset is rather symmetric and centered around 0, suggesting a reasonable average performance of the model. On the other hand, the residuals for the selected neighbors are centered around the value of 500. This sugests that, on average, the model predictions are biased for the instance of interest.

Upper panel: residuals calculated for all observations from the dataset. Bottom panel: residuals calculated for 25 nearest neighbors of the instance of interest.", out.width = '70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/bb_hist.png")
```

## Method {#cPLocDiagMethod}

The proposed method is based on three elements:

* identification of nearest neighbors,
* calculation and visualization of CP  profiles for the selected neighbors, and
* analysis of residuals for the neighbors.

In what follows we discuss each of the elements in more detail.

### Nearest neighbors {#cPLocDiagNeighbors}

There are two important questions related to the selection of the neighbors "nearest" to the instance (observation) of interest:

* How many neighbors should we choose?
* What metric should be used to measure the "proximity" of observations?

The answer to both questions is, of course, *it depends*. 

* The smaller the number of neighbors, the more local is the analysis. However, a very small number will lead to a larger variability of the results. In many cases we found that 20 works fine, but one shall always take into account computational time, size od data and other possibly important factors.
* The metric if very important. The more explanatory variables, the more important is the choice. In particular, the metric should be capable of accomodating variables of different natuer (categorical, continuous). Our default choice is the Gower similarity measure:

$$
d_{gower}(x_i, x_j) = \frac 1p \sum_{k=1}^p d_k(x_i^k, x_j^k),
$$
where $x_i$ is a $p$-dimensional vector of explanatory covariates for the $i$-th observation and $d_k(x_i^k,x_j^k)$ is the distance between values of the $k$-th variable for the $i$-th and $j$-th observations. Note that $d_k()$ depends on the nature of the variable. For instance, for a continuous variable it is equal to  $|x_i^k-x_j^k|/\{max(x_1^k,\ldots,x_n^k)-min(x_1^k,\ldots,x_n^k)\}$, i.e., the absolute difference scaled by the observed range of the variable. On the other hand, for a categorical variable, it is simply $I(x_i^k=x_j^k)$, where $I()$ is the indicator function. Note that $p$ may be equal to the number of all explanatory variables included in the model, or only a subset of them.

Once we have decided on the numer of neighbors, we can use the chosen metric to select the required number observations "closest" to the one of interest.

### Profiles for neighbors {#cPLocDiagProfiles}

Once nearest neighbors are identified, we can graphically compare CP profiles for selected (or all) variables. 

For a model with a large number of variables we may end up with a large number of plots. If the number of features is large, then we may easily end up with a large number of plots. In such a case a better strategy is to focus only on $K$ most important variables, selected by using the variable-importance measure (see Chapter  \@ref(ceterisParibusOscillations)).

### Local fidelity plot {#cPLocDiagLFplot}

CP profiles are helpful to assess the model stability. In addition, we can enhance the plot by adding residuals to it to allow evaluation of the local model fit. For model $f()$ and observation $i$ described by the vector of explanatory variables $x_i$, the residual is the difference between the observed and predicted value of the dependent variable $Y_i$, i.e.,

$$
r_i = y_i - f(x_i).
$$
Note that, for a binary variable `y`, the resiudal is the difference between 0 or 1, depending on how we code "success," and the predicted probability of "success." 

The plot that includes CP profiles for the nearest neighbors and the corresponding residuals is called a local fidelity plot. 

## Example: Titanic data {#cPLocDiagExample}

As an example, we will use the predictions for the random forest model for the Titanic data (see Section \@ref(model_titanic_rf)). We show profiles only for a single continuous explanatory variable, *age*. This makes the example easier to read without reducing the generality. [TOMASZ: NOT SURE. WOULD BE USEFUL TO SEE AN EXAMPLE FOR A FACTOR.]

Figure \@ref(fig:localFidelityPlots) presents a detailed explanation of the elements of a local fidelity plot. The plot includes eight nearest neighbors of Henry (see Section \@ref(predictions_titanic)). Profiles are quite apart from each other, which indicates potential instability of model predictions. However, the residuals included in the plots are positive and negative, indicating that, on average, the instance prediction should not be biased.

```{r localFidelityPlots, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(fig:localFidelityPlots) Elements of a local fidelity plot. The green line shows the Ceteris-paribus profile for the instance of intererst. Profiles forthe nearest neighbors are marked with grey lines. The vertical intervals correspond to residuals; the shorter the interval, the smaller the residual and the more accurate prediction of the model. Blue intervals correspond to positive residuals, red intervals to negative intervals. Stable model will have profiles close to each other; additive model will have parallel lines.", out.width = '70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/localFidelityPlots.png")
```


## Pros and cons {#cPLocDiagProsCons}

Local fidelity plots may be very helpful to validate if

* the model is locally additive, as for such models the CP profiles should be parallel
* the model is locally stable, as in that case the CP profiles should be close to each other
* the model fit for the instance of interest is good, as in that case the residuals should be small and balanced around 0.

The drawback is that such plots are quite complex and lack objective measures of the quality of the model fit. Thus, they are mainly suitable for exploratory analysis.


## Code snippets for R {#cPLocDiagR}

In this section, we show how to use the R package `ingredients` to construct local fidelity plots. More details and examples can be found at `https://modeloriented.github.io/ingredients/`.

We use the random forest [@R-randomForest] model `titanic_rf_v6` developed for the Titanic dataset (see Section \@ref(model_titanic_rf)) as the example. Recall that we deal with a binary classification problem - we want to predict the probability of survival for a selected passenger.

`DALEX` explainers for the model and the `Henry` data are retrieved via `archivist` hooks as listed in Chapter \@ref(ListOfModelsTitanic). 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library("randomForest")
explain_rf_v6 <- archivist::aread("pbiecek/models/9b971")

library("DALEX")
henry <- archivist::aread("pbiecek/models/a6538")
henry
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library("randomForest")
library("DALEX")
load("models/explain_rf_v6.rda")
load("models/henry.rda")
henry
```

We are going to recreate Figure \@ref(fig:profileWith10NN). To do this we need some number of passangers most similar to `henry`. The easiest way to do this is to use `ingredients::select_neighbours()` function. It returns `n` observations (by default 20) most similar to a observation of interest taking `distance` measure into account (by default Gower distance is used). 

In the example below we find from `titanic` dataset 10 nearest neighbors to `henry`, and the similarity is based only on two explanatory covariates, *gender*, and *class*. 

```{r titanicCeterisParibus04, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("ingredients")

henry_neighbors <- select_neighbours(titanic, 
                         henry, 
                         n = 10, 
                         variables = c("class", "gender"))
```

Now we are ready to plot profiles for henry and his neighbors. First we need to calculate corresponding profiles with `ceteris_paribus()` function introduced in Section \@ref(CPR). 

```{r titanicCeterisParibus03, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cp_henry <- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, 
                            henry,
                            variable_splits = list(age = seq(0,80,0.1)))
cp_henry_neighbors <- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, 
                            henry_neighbors,
                            variable_splits = list(age = seq(0,80,0.1)))
```

And we can plot both profiles. In Figure \ref(fig:titanicCeterisParibus05) we do this only for a single variable `age`.

```{r titanicCeterisParibus05, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, out.width = '70%', fig.align='center'}
library("ggplot2")

plot(cp_henry_neighbors, color = '#ceced9') +
  show_profiles(cp_henry, size = 2)  +
  ggtitle("Ceteris Paribus Profile for Henry and neighbors", "Calculated for titanic_rf_v6 model")
```

Now we will recreate the fidelity plot presented in Figure \@ref(fig:localFidelityPlots). To do this we need to add information about true values for selected neighbors.
It can be done through the `y` argument in the `ceteris_paribus()` function. 

The `y` argument takes numerical values. For our binary classification we have values `yes/no` in the `survived` variable, so to convert them to numerical values withe the `survived === "yes"` expression.

```{r titanicCeterisParibus06, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cp_henry_neighbors <- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6,
                          henry_neighbors, 
                          y = henry_neighbors$survived == "yes",
                          variable_splits = list(age = seq(0,80,0.1)))
```

Now we can add residuals the the plot with the  `show_residuals()` function. As a result, we obtain the local fidelity plot for `henry`.

```{r titanicCeterisParibus07, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(cp_henry_neighbors, color = '#ceced9') +
  show_profiles(cp_henry, size = 2) + 
  show_observations(cp_henry, variables = "age", size = 5) +
  show_residuals(cp_henry_neighbors, variables = "age") +
  ggtitle("Local Fidelity Plot for Henry","Calculated for titanic_rf_v6 model")
```

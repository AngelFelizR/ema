## Model lifecycle

Figure \@ref(fig:lifecycle) shows typical lifecycle of a predictive model. Part of the lifecycle are activities that lead to the model development. First, of course, we need to understand the domain of a problem, then we need to select important features, prepare important features, select the right model structure and viola! We have the model.

Once the model is created we still need to validate its performance. We need to support its deployment and maintenance.

```{r lifecycle, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(fig:lifecycle) Model lifecycle", out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/lifecycle.png")
```

As we will show, tools for model exploration, explanation and visualization may be useful in every phase of model lifecycle.

* Tools presented in chapter \@ref(variableImportance) helps to understand variable importance. They can be used in phase 2 - features selection.
* Tools presented in chapter \@ref(variableRelation) helps to understand variable effect. They can be used in phase 3 - features engineering.

Once the model is created, tools for model uderstanding have in general two applications.

* We can use them to contrast model behavior with our domain knowledge. This way we can validate if model behavior is consistent with our expectations / some imposed requirements.
* We can use them to extract some new knowledge about the domain. One possible application is to train a very elastic model to the dataset and then use model explainers to better understand relation between input variables and the target variable.

After model creation we may use model explainers to:

* Validate the model, some tools for that are presented in chapter ....
* Deploy the model. For deployed models we are interested in arguments agains particular decisions.
* Maintain the model. Monitor concept drift for a model.

Variable Atribution


This approach can be seen as an approximation of Shapley values where feature contribution is linked with the average effect of a feature across all possible relaxations. These approaches are identical for additive models. For non-additive models the additive attribution is just an approximation in both cases, yet the greedy strategy produces explanations that are easier to interpret.
It is worth noting that similar decomposition of predictions and measures of contribution for classifiers have been examined in \cite{4407709}.

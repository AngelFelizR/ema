We’ve released this initial version to get more feedback. Feedback can be given at the GitHub repo https://github.com/pbiecek/ema/issues. We are primarily interested in the organization and consistency of the content, but any comments will be welcomed. We’d like to thank everyone that contributed feedback, found typos, or ignited discussions while the book was being written, including GitHub contributors: agosiewska, Rees Morrison, kasiapekala, hbaniecki, AsiaHenzel, kozaka93, agilebean. 1.2 The aim of the book Predictive models are used to guess (statisticians would say: predict) values of a variable of interest based on values of other variables. As an example, consider prediction of sales based on historical data, prediction of the risk of heart disease based on patient’s characteristics, or prediction of political attitudes based on Facebook comments. Predictive models have been used throughout the entire human history. Ancient Egyptians, for instance, used observations of the rising of Sirius to predict flooding of the Nile. A more rigorous approach to model construction may be attributed to the method of least squares, published more than two centuries ago by Legendre in 1805 and by Gauss in 1809. With time, the number of applications in economy, medicine, biology, and agriculture has grown. The term regression was coined by Francis Galton in 1886. Initially, it was referring to biological applications, while today it is used for various models that allow prediction of continuous variables. Prediction of nominal variables is called classification, and its beginning may be attributed to works of Ronald Fisher in 1936. During the last century, many statistical models that can be used for predictive purposes have been developed. These include linear models, generalized linear models, regression and classification trees, rule-based models, and many others. Developments in mathematical foundations of predictive models were boosted by increasing computational power of personal computers and availability of large datasets in the era of “big data” that we have entered. With the increasing demand for predictive models, model properties such as flexibility, capability of internal variable selection or feature engineering, and high precision of predictions are of interest. To obtain robust models, ensembles of models are used. Techniques like bagging, boosting, or model stacking combine hundreds or thousands of simpler models into a one super-model. Large deep-neural models may have over a billion of parameters. There is a cost of this progress. Complex models may seem to operate like “black boxes”. It may be difficult, or even impossible, to understand how thousands of variables affect the model’s prediction. At the same time, complex models may not work as well as we would like them to. An overview of real problems with massive-scale black-box models may be found in an excellent book by O’Neil (2016) or in her TED Talk “The era of blind faith in big data must end”. There is a growing number of examples of predictive models with performance that deteriorated over time or became biased in some sense. For instance, IBM’s Watson for Oncology was criticized by oncologists for delivering unsafe and inaccurate recommendations (Ross and Swetliz 2018). Amazon’s system for curriculum-vitae screening was found to be biased against women (Dastin 2018). The COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) algorithm for predicting recidivism, developed by Northpointe (now Equivant), was accused to be biased against Afro-Americans (Larson et al. 2016). Algorithms behind the Apple Credit Card are blamed of being gender-biased (Duffy 2019). Some tools for sentiment analysis are suspected to be age-biased (Diaz et al. 2018). These are examples of models and algorithms that led to serious violations of fairness and ethical principles. An example of situation when data-drift led to a deterioration in model performance is the Google Flu model, which gave worse predictions after two years than at baseline (Salzberg 2014; Lazer et al. 2014). A reaction to some of these examples and issues are new regulations, like the General Data Protection Regulation (Gdpr 2018). Also, new civic rights are being formulated (Goodman and Flaxman 2016; Casey, Farhangi, and Vogl 2018; Ruiz 2018). A noteworthy example is the “Right to Explanation,” i.e., the right to be provided an explanation for an output of an automated algorithm (Goodman and Flaxman 2016). To exercise the right, we need new methods for verification, exploration, and explanation of predictive models. Figure 1.1 presents an attempt to summarize how the increase in the model complexity affects the relative importance of domain understanding, the choice of a model, and model validation. In classical statistics, models are often built as a result of good understanding of the application domain. Domain knowledge helps to create and select most important variables that can be included into relatively simple models that yield predictive scores. Model validation is based mainly on the evaluation of the goodness-of-fit and hypothesis testing. Statistical hypotheses shall be stated before data analysis and obtained p-values should not interfere with the way how data were processed or models were constructed. Machine learning, on the other hand, exploits the trade-off between availability of data and domain knowledge. The effort is shifted from a deep understanding of the application domain towards (computationally heavy) construction and fitting of models. Flexible models can use massive amounts of data to select informative variables and filter out uninformative ones. The validation step gains in importance, because it provides a feedback to the model construction. How can this approach look in the future? It is possible that the increasing automation of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the modelling part of the process will shift the focus towards the validation of a model. In particular, validation will not only focus on how good a model’s fit and predictions are, but also what other risks (like concept drift) or biases may be associated with the model. Exploring models will allow us to better and faster understand the analyzed data. Figure 1.1: Shift in the relative importance and effort (symbolically represented by the shaded boxes) put in different phases of data-driven modelling. Arrows show feedback loops in the modelling process. (A) In classical statistics, modelling is often based on deep understanding of the application domain combined with exploratory data analysis (EDA). Most often, (generalized) linear models are used. Model validation includes goodness-of-fit evaluation and hypothesis testing. (B) In machine learning (ML), domain knowledge and EDA are often limited. Instead, flexible models are fitted to large volumes of data to obtain a model offering a good predictive performance. Evaluation of the performance (applying strategies like cross-validation to deal with overfitting) gains in importance, as validation provides feedback to model construction. (C) In the (near?) future, auto-EDA and auto-ML will shift focus even further to model validation that will include the use of explainable artifical intelligence (XAI) techniques and evaluation of fairness, ethics, etc. The feedback loop is even longer now, as the results from model validation will also be helping in domain understanding. Summarizing, we can conclude that, today, the true bottleneck in predictive modelling is not the lack of data, nor the lack of computational power, nor inadequate algorithms, nor the lack of flexible models. It is the lack of tools for model exploration and, in particular, model explanation (obtaining insight into model-based predictions) and model examination (evaluation of model’s performance and understanding the weaknesses). Thus, in this book, we present a collection of methods that may be used for this purpose. As development of such methods is a very active area of research and new methods become available almost on a continuous basis, we do not aim at being exhaustive. Rather, we present the mind-set, key concepts and issues, and several examples of methods that can be used in model exploration. 1.3 A bit of philosophy: three laws of model explanation In 1942, in his story “Runaround,” Isaac Asimov formulated Three Laws of Robotics: a robot may not injure a human being, a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, and a robot must protect its own existence. Today’s robots, like cleaning robots, robotic pets, or autonomous cars are far from being conscious enough to fall under Asimov’s ethics. However, we are more and more surrounded by complex predictive models and algorithms used for decision making. Artificial-intelligence (AI) models are used in health care, politics, education, justice, and many other areas. The models and algorithms have a far larger influence on our lives than physical robots. Yet, applications of such models are left unregulated despite examples of their potential harmfulness. An excellent overview of selected issues is offered in the book by O’Neil (2016). It is now becoming clear that we have got to control the models and algorithms that may affect us. Asimov’s laws are being referred to in the context of the discussion around ethics of artificial intelligence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence). Initiatives to formulate principles for AI development have been undertaken, for instance, in the UK (Olhede and Wolfe 2018). Following Asimov’s approach, we propose three requirements that any predictive model should fulfill: Prediction’s validation. For every prediction of a model, one should be able to verify how strong is the evidence that confirms the prediction. Prediction’s justification. For every prediction of a model, one should be able to understand which variables affect the prediction and to what extent. Prediction’s speculation. For every prediction of a model, one should be able to understand how the model’s prediction would change if the values of the variables included in the model changed. We see two ways to comply with these requirements. One is to use only models that fulfill these conditions by design. These are so-called “interpretable-by-design models” that include linear models, rule-based models, or classification trees with a small number of parameters (Molnar 2019). However, the price for transparency may be a reduction in performance. Another way is to use tools that allow, perhaps by using approximations or simplifications, “explaining” predictions for any model. In our book, we focus on the latter approach. 1.4 Terminology It is worth noting that, when it comes to predictive models, the same concepts have often been given different names in statistics and in machine learning. Leo Breiman in the famous article “The Two Cultures” (Leo Breiman 2001b) described the similarities and differences in perspectives used by the two communities. For instance, in the statistical-modelling literature, one refers to “explanatory variables,” with “independent variables,” “predictors,” or “covariates” often used as equivalents. Explanatory variables are used in a model as means to explain (predict) the “dependent variable,” also called “predicted” variable or “response”. In machine-learning terminology, “input variables” or “features” are used to predict the “output” or “target” variable. In statistical modelling, models are “fit” to the data that contain “observations,” whereas in the machine-learning world a model is “trained” on a dataset that may contain “instances” or “cases”. When we talk about numerical constants that define a particular version of a model, in statistical modelling we refer to model “coefficients,” while in machine learning it is more customary to refer to model “parameters”. In statistics it is common to say that model coefficients are “estimated,” while in machine learning it is more common to say that parameters are “trained”. To the extent possible, in our book we try to consistently use the statistical-modelling terminology. However, the reader may find references to a “feature” here and there. Somewhat inconsistently, we also introduce the term “instance-level” explanation. Instance-level explanation methods are designed to extract information about the behavior of a model related to a specific observation (or instance). On the other hand, “dataset-level” explanation techniques allow obtaining information about the behavior of the model for an entire dataset. We consider models for dependent variables that can be continuous or categorical. The values of a continuous variable can be represented by numbers with an ordering that makes some sense (zip codes or phone numbers are not considered as continuous variables, while age or number of children are). A continuous variable does not have to be continuous in the mathematical sense; counts (number of floors, steps, etc.) will be treated as continuous variables as well. A categorical variable can assume only a finite set of values that are not numbers in the mathematical sense, i.e., it makes no sense to subtract or divide these values. In this book we treat models like “black-boxes”. We don’t assume anything about their internal structure or complexity. We discuss the specificity of such an approach in a bit more detail in the next section. 1.5 Black-box models and glass-box models Usually the term “black-box” model is used for models with a complex structure that is hard to understand by humans. This usually refers to a large number of model coefficients or complex mathematical transformations. As people vary in their capacity to understand complex models, there is no strict threshold for the number of coefficients that makes a model a black-box. In practice, for most people this threshold is probably closer to 10 than to 100. A “glass-box” (sometimes called a “white-box” or a “transparent-box”) model, which is opposite to a black-box one, is a model that is easy to understand (though maybe not by every person). It has a simple structure and a limited number of coefficients. The most common classes of glass-box models are decision- or regression trees (see an example in Figure 1.2), or models with an explicit compact structure. As an example of the latter, consider a model for obesity based on the body-mass index (BMI), with BMI defined as the mass (in kilograms) divided by the square of height (in meters). Subjects are classified as underweight if their BMI &lt; 18, as normal if their BMI lies in the interval (18, 25), and as overweight if their BMI &gt; 25. The compact form of the model makes it is easy to understand, for example, how changes in BMI change the predicted obesity-class. The structure of a glass-box model is, in general, easy to understand. It may be difficult to collect the necessary data, build the model, fit it to the data, or perform model validation, but once the model has been developed its interpretation and mode of working is straightforward. Why is it important to understand a model’s structure? There are several important advantages. If the structure is transparent, we can easily see which explanatory variables are included in the model and which are not. Hence, for instance, we may be able to question the model from which a particular explanatory variable is excluded. Also, in the case of a model with a transparent structure and a limited number of coefficients, we can easily link changes in the model’s predictions with changes in particular explanatory variables. This, in turn, may allow us to challenge the model against domain knowledge if, for instance, the effect of a particular variable on predictions is inconsistent with previously-established results. Note that linking changes in the model’s predictions to changes in particular explanatory variables may be difficult when there are many variables and/or coefficients in the model. For instance, a classification tree with hundreds of nodes is difficult to understand, as is a linear regression model with hundreds of coefficients. Figure 1.2: An example of a decision-tree model for melanoma risk patients developed by Donizy et al. (2016). The model is based on two explanatory variables, Breslow thickness and the presenece of tumor infiltration lymphocytes. These two variables classify patients into three groups with a different probability of survival. Note that some glass-box models, like the decision-tree model presented in Figure 1.2, satisfy by design the explainability laws introduced in Section 1.3. In particular, regarding prediction’s validation, we see how many patients fall in a given category in each node. With respect to prediction’s justification, we know which variables are used in every decision path. Finally, regarding prediction’s speculation, we can trace how changes in particular variables will affect the model’s prediction. We can, of course, argue if the model is good or not, but the model structure is obviously transparent. Comprehending the performance of a black-box models presents more challenges. The structure of a complex model, such as, for example, a neural-network model, may be far from transparent. Consequently, we may not understand which features influence the model decisions and by how much. Consequently, it may be difficult to decide whether the model is consistent with our domain knowledge. In our book we present tools that can help in extracting the information necessary for the evaluation of models in a model-agnostic fashion, i.e., in the same way regardless of the complexity of the analysed model. 1.6 Model-agnostic and model-specific approach Interest in model interpretability is as old as the statistical modelling itself. Some classes of models have been developed for a long period or have attracted intensive research. Consequently, those classes of models are equipped with excellent tools for model exploration, validation, or visualisation. For example: There are many tools for diagnostics and evaluation of linear models, see, for example, Galecki and Burzykowski (2013) or Faraway (2002). Model assumptions are formally defined (normality, linear structure, homogeneity of variance) and can be checked by using normality tests or plots (like normal qq-plot), diagnostic plots, tests for model structure, tools for identification of outliers, etc. A similar situation applies to generalized linear models, see, for example, Dobson (2002). For more advanced models with an additive structure, like the proportional hazards model, many tools can be used for checking model assumptions, see, for example, Harrell Jr (2018) or Sheather (2009). Random-forest models are equipped with the out-of-bag method of evaluating performance and several tools for measuring variable importance (Breiman et al. 2018). Methods have been developed to extract information about possible interactions from the model structure (Paluszynska and Biecek 2017), (Ehrlinger 2016). Similar tools have been developed for other ensembles of trees, like boosting models, see, for example, Foster (2017) or Karbowiak and Biecek (2019). Neural networks enjoy a large collection of dedicated model-explanation tools that use, for instance, the layer-wise relevance propagation technique (Bach et al. 2015), saliency maps technique (Simonyan, Vedaldi, and Zisserman 2013), or a mixed approach. A summary can be found in Samek, Wiegand, and Müller (2017) and Alber et al. (2018). The “Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers” (BERT) family of models leads to high-performance models in Natural Language Processing. The exBERT method (Hoover, Strobelt, and Gehrmann 2019) is designed to visualize the activation of attention heads in this model. Of course, the list of model classes with dedicated collections of model-explanation and/or diagnostics methods is much longer. This variety of model-specific approaches does lead to issues, though. For instance, one cannot easily compare explanations for two models with different structures. Also, every time a new architecture or a new ensemble of models is proposed, one needs to look for new methods of model exploration. Finally, no tools for model explanation or diagnostics may be immediately available for brand-new models. For these reasons, in our book we focus on model-agnostic techniques. In particular, we prefer not to assume anything about the model structure, as we may be dealing with a black-box model with an unspecified structure. Often we do not have access to model coeffcients, but only to a specified Application Programming Interface (API) that allows for querying remote models as, for example, in Microsoft Cognitive Services (Azure 2019). In that case, the only operation that we may be able to perform is the evaluation of a model on a specified set of data. However, while we do not assume anything about the structure of the model, we will assume that the model operates on \\(p\\)-dimensional vector of explanatory variables/features and, for a single observation, it returns a single value (score/probability) which is a real number. This assumption holds for a broad range of models for data such as tabular data, images, text data, videos, etc. It may not be suitable for, e.g., models with memory-like sequence-to-sequence models (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014) or Long Short-Term Memory models (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) in which the model output depends also on sequence of previous inputs, or generative models that output text of images. 1.7 The structure of the book This book is split in four major parts. In the first part, Introduction, we introduce notation, datasets, and models used in the book. In the second part, Instance-level exploration, we present techniques for exploration and explanation of a model’s predictions for a single observation. In the third part, Dataset-level exploration, we present techniques for exploration and explanation of a model for an entire dataset. In the forth part, Use-case, we applying all discussed techniques on the example of the problem of assessing the value of a football player. The structure of the second and the third part is presented in Figure 1.3. Figure 1.3: Model exploration methods presented in the book. The left-hand side (corresponding to the second part of the book) focuses on instance-level exploration, while the right-hand side (corresponding to the third part of the book) focuses on dataset-level exploration. Consecutive layers of the stack are linked with a deeper level of model exploration. The layers are linked with law’s of model exploration introduced in Section 1.3. In more detail, the first part of the book consists of Chapters 2–5. In Chapter 2, we provide a short introduction to the process of data exploration and model construction, together with notation and definition of key concepts that are used in consecutive chapters. Moreover, in Chapters 3 and 4, we provide a short description of R and Python tools and packages that are necessary to replicate the results presented in this book. Finally, in Chapter 5, we describe two datasets that are used throughout the book to illustrate the presented methods and tools. The second part of the book focuses on instance-level explainers and consists of Chapters 7–14. Chapters 7–9 present methods that allow decomposing a model’s predictions into contributions corresponding to each explanatory variable. In particular, Chapter 7 introduces break-down (BD) for additive attributions for predictive models, while Chapter 8 extends this method to attributions that include interactions. Chapter 9 describes Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) (Lundberg and Lee 2017), an alternative method for decomposing a model’s predictions that is closely linked with Shapley values developed originally for cooperative games by Shapley (1953). Chapter 10 presents a different approach to explanation of single-instance predictions. It is based on a local approximation of a black-box model by a simpler glass-box one. In this chapter, we discuss the Local-Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016). These chapters correspond to the second layer of the stack presented in Figure 1.3. In Chapters 11–13 we present methods based on the ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles. The profiles show the change of model-based predictions induced by a change of a single explanatory-variable. The profiles are introduced in Chapter 11, while Chapter 12 presents a CP-profile-based measure that summarizes the impact of a selected variable on model’s predictions. The measure can be used to determine the order of variables in model exploration. It is particularly important for models with large numbers of explanatory variables. Chapter 13 focuses on model diagnostics. It describes local-stability plots that are useful to investigate the sources of a poor prediction for a particular single observation. The final chapter of the second part, Chapter 14, compares various methods for instance-level exploration. The third part of the book focuses on dataset-level exploration and consists of Chapters 15–20. The chapters present methods in the same order as shown in the right-hand side of Figure 1.3. In particular, Chapter 16 presents measures that are useful for the evaluation of the overall performance of a predictive model. Chapter 17 describes methods that are useful for the evaluation of an explanatory-variable’s importance. Chapters 18 and 19 introduce partial-dependence and accumulated-dependence methods for univariate exploration of a variable’s effect. These methods correspond to the third (from the top) layer of the right-hand side of the stack presented in Figure 1.3. The final chapter of this part of the book is Chapter 20 that summarises diagnostic techniques based on model residuals. The book is concluded with Chapter 21 that presents a worked-out example of model-development process in which we apply all the methods discused in the second and third part of the book. To make the exploration of the book easier, each chapter of the second and third part of the book has the same structure: Section Introduction explains the goal of and the general idea behind the method(s) presented in the chapter. Section Method shows mathematical or computational details related to the method(s). This subsection can be skipped if you are not interested in the details. Section Example shows an exemplary application of the method(s) with discussion of results. Section Pros and cons summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the method(s). It also provides some guidance regarding when to use the method(s). Section Code snippets shows the implementation of the method(s) in R and Python. This subsection can be skipped if you are not interested in the implementation. 1.8 What is included in this book and what is not The area of model exploration and explainability is quickly growing and is present in many different flavors. Instead of showing every existing method (is it really possible?), we rather selected a subset of consistent tools that form a good starting toolbox for model exploration. We mainly focus on the impact of the model exploration and explanation tools rather than on selected methods. We believe that by providing the knowledge about the potential of model exploration methods and of the language of model explanation, we will help the reader in improving the process of data modelling. Taking this goal into account in this book, we do show how to determine which explanatory variables affect a model’s prediction for a single observation. In particular, we present the theory and examples of methods that can be used to explain prediction like break-down plots, ceteris-paribus profiles, local-model approximations, or Shapley values; techniques to examine predictive models as a whole. In particular, we review the theory and examples of methods that can be used to explain model performance globally, like partial-dependence plots or variable-importance plots; charts that can be used to present the key information in a quick way; tools and methods for model comparison; code snippets for R and Python that explain how to use the described methods. On the other hand, in this book, we do not focus on any specific model. The techniques presented are model-agnostic and do not make any assumptions related to the model structure; data exploration. There are very good books on this topic by, for example, Grolemund and Wickham (2019) or Wes (2012), or the excellent classic by Tukey (1977); the process of model building. There are also very good books on this topic by, for instance, Venables and Ripley (2002), James et al. (2014), or Efron and Hastie (2016); any particular tools for model building. These are discussed, for instance, by Kuhn and Johnson (2013). 1.9 Acknowledgements This book has been prepared by using the bookdown package (Xie 2018), created thanks to the amazing work of Yihui Xie.

In explanatory modelling, models are applied for inferential purposes, i.e., to test hypotheses resulting from some theoretical considerations related to the investigated phenomenon (for instance, related to the effect of a particular clinical factor on a probability of a disease). In predictive modelling, models are used for the purpose of predicting the value of a new or future observation (for instance, whether a person has got or will develop a disease). It is important to know what is the intended purpose of modelling, because it has got important consequences for the methods used in the model-development process. In this book, we focus on predictive modelling. Thus, we present mainly the methods relevant for predictive models. Nevertheless, we also show selected methods used in case of explanatory models, in order to discuss, if relevant, substantive differences between the methods applied to the two approaches to modelling. Predictive models are created for various purposes. For instance, a team of data scientists may spend months on developing a single model that will be used for scoring risks of transactions in a large financial company. In that case, every aspect of the model is important, as the model will be used on a large scale and will have important long-term consequences for the company. Hence, the model-development process may be lengthy and tedious. On the other hand, if a small pizza-delivery chain may want to develop a simple model to roughly predict the demand for deliveries, the development process may be much shorter and less complicated. In that case, the model may be quickly updated or even discarded, without major consequences. Irrespectively of the goals of modelling, model-development process involves similar steps. In this chapter, we briefly discuss these steps. 2.2 Model-development process Several approaches have been proposed to describe the process of model development. One of the most known general approaches is the Cross-industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) (Chapman et al. 1999; Wikipedia 2019). Methodologies specific for predictive models have been introduced also by Grolemund and Wickham (2019), Hall (2019), and Biecek (2019). The common goal of the approaches is to standardize the process. Standardization can help to plan resources needed to develop and maintain a model, and to make sure that no important steps are missed when developing the model. CRISP-DM is a tool-agnostic procedure. It breaks the model-development process into six phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment. The phases can be iterated. Note that iterative phases are also considered by Grolemund and Wickham (2019) and Hall (2019). Figure 2.1 presents a variant of the iterative process, divided into five steps. Data collection and preparation is needed prior to any modelling. One cannot hope for building a model with a good performance if the data are not of good quality. Once data have been collected, they have to be explored to understand their structure. Subsequently, a model can be selected and fitted to the data. The constructed model should be validated. The three steps: data understanding, model assembly, and model audit, are often iterated to arrive at a point when, for instance, a model with the best predictive performance is obtained. Once the “best” model has been obtained, it can be “delivered,” i.e., implemented in practice after performing tests and developing the necessary documentation. Figure 2.1: Lifecycle of a predictive model. The Model-development Process (MDP), proposed by Biecek (2019), has been motivated by Rational Unified Process for Software Development (Kruchten 1998; Jacobson, Booch, and Rumbaugh 1999; Boehm 1988). MDP can be seen as an extension of the scheme presented in Figure 2.1. MDP recognizes that fact that consecutive iterations are not identical, because the knowledge increases during the process and consecutive iterations are performed with different goals in mind. This is why MDP is presented in Figure 2.2 as an untangled version of Figure 2.1. The five phases, present in CRIPSP-DM, are shown in the rows. A single bar in each row represents an amount of resources (for instance, a week-worth workload) that can be devoted to the project at a specific time-point (indicated on the horizontal axis). For a particular phase, resources can be used in different amounts depending on the current stage of the process, as indicated by the height of the bars. The stages are indicated at the top of the diagram in Figure 2.2: problem formulation, crisp modelling, fine tuning, and maintenance and decomissioning. Problem formulation aims at defining the needs for the model, defining datasets that will be used for training and validation, and deciding which performance measures will be used for the evaluation of the performance of the final model. Crisp modelling focuses on creation of first versions of the model that may provide an idea about, for instance, how complex may the model have to be to yield the desired solution? Fine tuning focuses on improving the initial version(s) of the model and selecting the best one according to the pre-defined metrics. Finally, maintainance and decommissioning aims at monitoring the performance of the model after its implementation. Note that, unlike in CRISP-DM, the diagram in Figure 2.2 indicates that the process may start with some resources being spent not on the data-preparation phase, but on the model-audit one. This is because, at the problem formulation stage, we may have to spend some time on defining the goals and model-performance metrics (that will be used in model benchmarking) before any attempt to collect the data. Figure 2.2 also indicates that there may be several iterations of the different phases within each stage, as indicated at the bottom of the diagram. For instance, in the crisp-modelling stage, several versions of a model may be prepared in subsequent iterations. Figure 2.2: Overview of the model-development process. The process is split into five different phases (rows) and four stages (indicated at the top of the diagram). Horizontal axis presents the time from the problem formulation to putting the model into practice (decommissioning). For a particular phase, resources can be used in different amounts depending on the current stage of the process, as indicated by the height of the bars. There may be several iterations of different phases withhin each stage, as indicated at the bottom of the diagram. Methods presented in this book can be used to get a better understanding the data and the application domain (exploration), obtaining insight into model-based predictions (model explanation), and evaluation of model’s performance (model examination). Thus, refering to MDP in Figure 2.2, the methods are suitable for data understanding, model assembly, and model audit phases. In the remainder of the chapter we provide a brief overview of the notation that will be used in the book, and the methods commonly used for data exploration, model fitting, and model validation. 2.3 Notation Methods described in this book have been developed by different authors, who used different mathematical notations. We have made an attempt at keeping the mathematical notation consistent throughout the entire book. In some cases this may result in formulas with a fairly complex system of indices. In this section, we provide a general overview of the notation we use. Whenever necessary, parts of the notation will be explained again in subsequent chapters. We use capital letters like \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\) to denote (scalar) random variables. Observed values of these variables are denoted by lower-case letters like \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). Vectors and matrices are distinguished by underlining the letter. Thus, \\(\\underline{X}\\) and \\(\\underline{x}\\) denote matrix \\(X\\) and (column) vector \\(x\\), respectively. Note, however, that in some situations \\(\\underline{X}\\) may indicate a vector of (scalar) random variables. We explicitly mention this when needed. Transposition is indicated by the prime, i.e., \\(\\underline{x}&#39;\\) is the row vector resulting from transposition of a column vector \\(\\underline{x}\\). We use notation \\(E(Y)\\) and \\(Var(Y)\\) to denote the expected (mean) value and variance of random variable \\(Y\\). If needed, we use a subscript to indicate the distribution used to compute the parameters. Thus, for instance, we use \\[E_{Y|X=x}(Y) = E_{Y|x}(Y) = E_{Y}(Y|X=x) \\] to indicate the conditional mean of \\(Y\\) given that random variable \\(X\\) assumes the value of \\(x\\). We assume that the data available for modelling consist of \\(n\\) observations/instances. For the \\(i\\)-th observation, we have got an observed value \\(y_i\\) of a dependent (random) variable \\(Y\\). We assume that \\(Y\\) is a scalar, i.e., a single number. In case of dependent categorical variable, we usually consider \\(Y\\) to be a binary indicator of observing a particular category. Additionally, each observation from a dataset is described by \\(p\\) explanatory variables. We refer to the (column) vector of the explanatory variables, describing the \\(i\\)-th observation, by \\(\\underline{x}_i\\). We can thus consider observations as points in a \\(p\\)-dimensional space \\(\\mathcal X \\equiv \\mathcal R^p\\), with \\(\\underline{x}_i \\in \\mathcal X\\). We often collect all explanatory-variable data in the \\(n\\times p\\) matrix \\(\\underline{X}\\) that contains, in the \\(i\\)-th row, vector \\(\\underline{x}&#39;_i\\). When introducing some of the model-exploration methods, we often consider “an observation of interest,” for which the vector of explanatory variables is denoted by \\(x_{*}\\). As the observation may not necessarily belong to the analyzed dataset, we use of the asterisk in the subscript. Clearly, \\(\\underline{x}_{*} \\in \\mathcal X\\). We refer to the \\(j\\)-th coordinate of vector \\(\\underline{x}\\) by using \\(j\\) in superscript. Thus, \\(\\underline{x}_i = ({x}^1_i, \\ldots , {x}^p_i)&#39;\\), where \\({x}^j_i\\) denotes the \\(j\\)-th coordinate of vector \\(\\underline{x}_i\\) for the \\(i\\)-th observation from the analyzed dataset. If a power (for instance, a square) of \\({x}^j_i\\) is needed, it will be denoted by using parentheses, i.e., \\(\\left({x}^j_i\\right)^2\\). If \\(\\mathcal J\\) denotes a subset of indices, then \\(\\underline{x}^{\\mathcal J}\\) denotes the vector formed by the coordinates of \\(\\underline{x}\\) corresponding to the indices included in \\(\\mathcal J\\). We use \\(\\underline{x}^{-j}\\) to refer to a vector that results from removing the \\(j\\)-th coordinate from vector \\(\\underline{x}\\). By \\(\\underline{x}^{j|=z}\\), we denote a vector in which all coordinates are equal to their values in \\(\\underline{x}\\), except of the \\(j\\)-th coordinate, which values is set equal to \\(z\\). Thus, \\(\\underline{x}^{j|=z} = ({x}^1, \\ldots, {x}^{j-1}, z, {x}^{j+1}, \\ldots, {x}^p)&#39;\\). Notation \\(\\underline{X}^{*j}\\) is used to denote a matrix with the values as in \\(\\underline{X}\\) except of the \\(j\\)-th column, for which elements are permuted. In this book, a model is a function \\(f:\\mathcal X \\rightarrow \\mathcal R\\) that transforms a point from \\(\\mathcal X\\) into a real number. In most cases, the presented methods can be used directly for multi-variate dependent variables; however, we use examples with uni-variate responses to simplify the notation. Typically, during the model development, we create many competing models. Formally, we shall index models to refer to a specific version fitted to a dataset. However, for the sake of simplicity, we will omit the index when it is not important. For the same reason we ignore in the notation the fact that, in practice, we never know true model coefficients and use the estimated values. We use the term “model residual” to indicate the difference between the observed value of the dependent variable \\(Y\\) for the \\(i\\)-th observation from a particular dataset and the model’s prediction for the observation: \\[\\begin{equation} r_i = y_i - f(x_i) = y_i - \\hat y_i, \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\hat y_i\\) denotes the predicted (or fitted) value of \\(y_i\\). More information about residuals is provided in Chapter 20. 2.4 Data understanding As indicated in Figures 2.1 and 2.2, before starting construction of any models, we have got to understand the data. Toward this aim, tools for data exploration such as visualization techniques, tabular summaries, and statistical methods can be used. The choice of the tools depend on the character of variables included in a dataset. The most known introduction to data exploration is the famous book by Tukey (1977). It introduces the (now classical) tools like, for example, box-and-whisker plots or stem-and-leaf plots. Good overviews of techniques for data exploration can also be found in books by Nolan and Lang (2015) and Wickham and Grolemund (2017). In this book, we rely on five visualization techniques for data exploration, schematically presented in Figure 2.3. Two of them (histogram and empirical cumulative-distribution (ECD) plot) are used to summarize the distribution of a single random (explanatory or dependent) variable; the remaining three (box plot, mosaic plot, box plot, and scatter plot) are used to explore relationship between pairs of variables. Note that histogram can be used to explore the distribution of a continuous or a categorical variable, while the ECD plot and box plot are suitable for continuous variables. Mosaic plot is useful for exploring relationship between two categorical variables, while scatter plot can be applied for two continuous variables. It is worth noting that box plots can also be used for evaluating a relation between a categorical variable and a continuous one, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: Selected methods for visual data exploration applied in this book. Exploration of data for the dependent variable usually focuses on the question related to the distribution of the variable. For instance, for a continuous variable, questions like approximate normality or symmetry of the distribution are most often of interest, because of the availability of many powerful methods and models that use the normality assumption. In case of asymmetry (skewness), a possibility of a transformation that could make the distirbution approximately symmetric or normal is usually investigated. For a categorical dependent variable, an important question is whether the proportion of observations in different categories is balanced or not. This is because, for instance, some methods related to the classification problem do not work well with if there is a substantial imbalance between the categories. Exploration of data for explanatory variables may also include investigation of their distribution. This is because the results may reveal, for instance, that there is little variability in the observed values of a variable. As a consequence, the variable might be deemed not interesting from a model-construction point of view. Usually, however, the exploration focuses on the relationship between explanatory variables themselves on one hand, and their relationship with the dependent variable on the other hand. The results may have important consequences for the model construction. For instance, if an explanatory variable does not appear to be related to the dependent variable, it may be dropped from a model (variable selection/filtering). The exploration results may also suggest, for instance, a need for a transformation of an explanatory variable to make its relationship with the dependent variable linear (variable engineering). Detection of pairs of strongly-correlated explanatory variables is also of interest, as it may help in resolving issues with, for instance, instability of optimization algorithms used for fitting of a model. 2.5 Model assembly (fitting) In statistical modelling, we are interested in the distribution of a dependent variable \\(Y\\) given \\(\\underline{x}\\), the vector of values of explanatory variables. In the ideal world, we would like to know the entire conditional distribution. In practical applications, however, we usually do not evaluate the entire distribution, but just some of its characteristics, like the expected (mean) value, a quantile, or variance. Without loss of generality we will assume that we model the conditional expected value of \\(Y\\), i.e., \\(E_{Y | \\underline{x}}(Y)\\). Assume that we have got model \\(f()\\), for which \\(f(\\underline{x})\\) is an approximation of \\(E_{Y | \\underline{x}}(Y)\\), i.e., \\(E_{Y | \\underline{x}}(Y) \\approx f(\\underline{x})\\). Note that, in our book, we do not assume that it is a “good” model, nor that the approximation is precise. We simply assume that we have got a model that is used to estimate the conditional expected value and to form predictions of the values of the dependent variable. Our interest lies in the evaluation of the quality of the predictions. If the model offers a “good” approximation of the conditional expected value, it should be reflected in its satisfactory predictive performance. Usually, when building a model, the available data are split into two parts. One part, often called a “training set” or “learning data,” is used for estimation of the model coefficients. The other part, called a “testing set” or “validation data,” is used for model validation. The splitting may be done repeatedly, as in k-fold cross-validation. We leave the topic of model validation for Chapter 16. The process of estimation of model coefficients based on the training data, i.e., “fitting” of the model, differs for different models. In most cases, however, it can be seen as an optimization problem. Let \\(\\Theta\\) be the space of all possible values of model coefficients. Model fitting (or training) is a procedure of selecting a value \\(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}} \\in \\Theta\\) that minimizes some loss function \\(L()\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\underline{\\theta}} = \\arg \\min_{\\underline{\\theta} \\in \\Theta} L\\{\\underline{y}, f(\\underline{\\theta};\\underline{X})\\}, \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\underline{y}\\) is the vector of observed values of the dependent variable and \\(f(\\underline{\\theta}; \\underline{X})\\}\\) is the corresponding vector of the model’s predictions computed for model coefficients \\(\\underline{\\theta}\\) and matrix \\(\\underline{X}\\) of values of explanatory variables for the observations from the training dataset. Denote the estimated form of the model by \\(f(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}};\\underline{X})\\). Consider predcition of a new observation for which the vector of explanatory variables assumes the value of \\(\\underline{x}_*\\), i.e., \\(f(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}};\\underline{x}_*)\\). Assume that \\(E_{Y | \\underline{x}_*}(Y) = f(\\underline{\\theta};\\underline{x}_*)\\). It can be shown (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009; Shmueli 2010) that the expected squared-error of prediction can be expressed as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} E_{(Y,\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}})|\\underline{x}_*}\\{Y-f(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}};\\underline{x}_*)\\}^2= \\phantom{E_{Y|\\underline{x}_*}\\{Y-f(\\underline{\\theta};\\underline{x}_*)\\}^2 + [f(\\underline{\\theta};\\underline{x}_*)-E_{\\underline{y}|\\underline{x}_*}\\{{f}(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}};\\underline{x}_*)\\}]^2 + E_{\\underline{y}|\\underline{x}_*}[{f}(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}};\\underline{x}_*)-E_{\\underline{y}|\\underline{x}_*}\\{{f}(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}};\\underline{x}_*)\\}]^2 } \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{eqnarray} &amp;=&amp;E_{Y|\\underline{x}_*}\\{Y-f(\\underline{\\theta};\\underline{x}_*)\\}^2 + [f(\\underline{\\theta};\\underline{x}_*)-E_{\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}}|\\underline{x}_*}\\{{f}(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}};\\underline{x}_*)\\}]^2 + E_{\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}}|\\underline{x}_*}[{f}(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}};\\underline{x}_*)-E_{\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}}|\\underline{x}_*}\\{{f}(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}};\\underline{x}_*)\\}]^2\\\\ &amp;=&amp; Var_{Y|\\underline{x}_*}(Y)+Bias^2+Var_{\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}}|\\underline{x}_*}\\{\\hat{f}(\\underline{x}_*)\\}. \\tag{2.3} \\end{eqnarray}\\] The first term on the right-hand-side of equation (2.3) is the variability of \\(Y\\) around its conditonal expected value \\(f(\\underline{\\theta};\\underline{x}_*)\\). In general, it cannot be reduced. The second term is the squared difference between the expected value and its estimate, i.e., the squared bias. Bias results from misspecifying the model by, for instance, using a more parsimonious or a simpler model. The third term is the variance of the estimate, due to the fact that we use training data to estimate the model. The decomposition presented in (2.3) underlines an important difference between the explanatory and predictive modelling. In the explanatory modelling, the goal is to minimize the bias, as we are interested in obtaining the most accurate representation of the investigated phenomenon and the related theory. In the predictive modelling, the focus is on minimization of the sum of the (squared) bias and the estimation variance, because we are interested in minimization of the prediction error. Thus, sometimes we can accept a certain amount of bias, if it leads to a substantial gain in precision of estimation and, consequently, in a smaller prediction error (Shmueli 2010). It follows that the choice of the loss function \\(L()\\) in equation (2.2) may differ for explanatory and predictive modelling. For the former, it is common to assume some family of probability distributions for the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(\\underline{x}\\). In such case, the loss function \\(L()\\) may be defined as the negative logarithm of the likelihood function, where likelihood is the probability of observing \\(\\underline{y}\\), given \\(\\underline{X}\\), treated as a function of \\(\\underline{\\theta}\\). The resulting estimate of \\(\\underline{\\theta}\\) is usually denoted by \\(\\hat{\\underline{\\theta}}\\). In predictive modelling, it is common to add term \\(\\lambda(\\underline{\\theta})\\) to the loss function that “penalizes” for the use of more complex models: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tilde{\\underline{\\theta}} = \\arg \\min_{\\underline{\\theta} \\in \\Theta} \\left[L\\{\\underline{y}, f(\\underline{\\theta};\\underline{X})\\} + \\lambda(\\underline{\\theta})\\right]. \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] For example, in linear regression we assume that the observed vector \\(\\underline{y}\\) follows a multi-variate Gaussian distribution: \\[ \\underline{y} \\sim \\mathcal N(\\underline{X}&#39; \\underline{\\beta}, \\sigma^2\\underline{I}_n), \\] where \\(\\underline{\\theta}&#39; = (\\underline{\\beta}&#39;, \\sigma^2)\\) and \\(\\underline{I}_n\\) denotes the \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix. In this case, equation (2.4) becomes \\[\\begin{equation} \\tilde{\\underline{\\theta}} = \\arg \\min_{\\underline{\\theta} \\in \\Theta}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{n}||\\underline{y} - \\underline{X}&#39; \\underline{\\beta}||_{2} + \\lambda(\\underline{\\beta}) \\right\\}= \\arg \\min_{\\underline{\\theta} \\in \\Theta} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\underline{x}&#39;_i\\underline{\\beta})^2+ \\lambda(\\underline{\\beta}) \\right\\}. \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] For the classcal linear regression, the penalty term \\(\\lambda(\\underline{\\beta})\\) is equal to \\(0\\). In that case, the optimal parameters \\(\\hat{\\underline{\\beta}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), obtained from (2.2), can be expressed in a closed form: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat{\\underline{\\beta}} &amp;=&amp; (\\underline{X}&#39;\\underline{X})^{-1}\\underline{X}&#39;\\underline{y},\\\\ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{n}||\\underline{y} - \\underline{X}&#39; \\hat{\\underline{\\beta}}||_{2} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\underline{x}&#39;_i\\hat{\\underline{\\beta}})^2= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] On the other hand, in ridge regression, the penalty function is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda(\\underline{\\beta}) = \\lambda \\cdot ||\\underline{\\beta}||_2 = \\lambda \\sum_{k=1}^p (\\beta^k) ^2. \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] In that case, the optimal parameters \\(\\tilde{\\underline{\\beta}}\\) and \\(\\tilde{\\sigma}^2\\), obtained from equation (2.4), can also be expressed in a closed form: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\tilde{\\underline{\\beta}} &amp;=&amp; (\\underline{X}&#39;\\underline{X} + \\lambda \\underline{I}_n)^{-1}\\underline{X}&#39;\\underline{y},\\\\ \\tilde{\\sigma}^2 &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{n}||\\underline{y} - \\underline{X}&#39; \\tilde{\\underline{\\beta}}||_{2}. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that ridge regression leads to non-zero squared-bias in equation (2.3), but at the benefit of a reduced estimation variance (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009). Another possible form of penalty, used in the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda(\\underline{\\beta}) = \\lambda \\cdot ||\\underline{\\beta}||_1 = \\lambda \\sum_{k=1}^p |\\beta^k|. \\tag{2.7} \\end{equation}\\] In that case, \\(\\tilde{\\underline{\\beta}}\\) and \\(\\tilde{\\sigma}^2\\) have to be estimated by using a numerical optimization procedure. For a binary dependent variable, i.e., a classification problem, the natural choice for the distribution of \\(Y\\) is the Bernoulli distribution. The resulting loss function, based on the logarithm of the Bernoulli likelihood, is \\[\\begin{equation} L(\\underline{y},\\underline{p})=-\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\{y_i\\ln{p_i}+(1-y_i)\\ln{(1-p_i)}\\}, \\tag{2.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_i\\) is equal to 0 or 1 in case of “no response” and “response” (or “failure” and “success”), and \\(p_i\\) is the probability of \\(y_i\\) being equal to 1. Function (2.8) is often called “log-loss” or “binary cross-entropy” in machine-learning literature. A popular model for binary data is logistic regression, for which \\[ \\ln{\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}}=\\underline{x}_i&#39;\\underline{\\beta}. \\] In that case, the loss function in equation (2.8) becomes equal to \\[\\begin{equation} L\\{\\underline{y},f(\\underline{\\beta},\\underline{X})\\}=-\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n [y_i\\underline{x}_i&#39;\\underline{\\beta}-\\ln\\{1+\\exp(\\underline{x}_i&#39;\\underline{\\beta})\\}]. \\tag{2.9} \\end{equation}\\] Optimal values of parameters \\(\\hat{\\underline{\\beta}}\\), resulting from equation (2.2), have to be found by numerical optimization algorithms. Of course, one can combine the loss functions in equations (2.8) and (2.9) with penalties (2.6) or (2.7) . For a categorical dependent variable, i.e., a multilabel classification problem, the natural choice for the distribution of \\(Y\\) is the multinomial distribution. The resulting loss function, in case of \\(K\\) categories, is given by \\[\\begin{equation} L(\\underline{Y},\\underline{P})=-\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{k=1}^K y_{ik}\\ln{p_{ik}}, \\tag{2.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ik}=1\\) if the \\(k\\)-th category was noted for the \\(i\\)-th observation and 0 otherwise, and \\(p_{ik}\\) is the probability of \\(y_{ik}\\) being equal to 1. Function (2.10) is often called “categorical cross-entropy” in machine-learning literature. Also in this case, optimal parameters \\(\\hat{\\underline{\\beta}}\\), resulting from equation (2.2), have to be found by numerical optimization algorithms. 2.6 Model audit As indicated in Figure 2.2, the modelling process starts with some crisp early versions that are fine tuned in consecutive iterations. To arrive at a final model, we usually have got to evaluate (audit) numerous candidate models that. In this book, we introduce techniques that allow: decomposing a model’s predictions into components that can be attributed to particular explanatory variables (Chapters 7–10); conducting sensitivity analysis for a model’s predictions (Chapter 11–13); summarizing the predictive performance of a model (Chapter 16). In particular, the presented measures are usually used to trace the progress in model development. assessing the importance of an explanatory variable (Chapter 17). The techniques can be helpful in reducing the set of explanatory variables to be included in a model in the fine-tuning stage. evaluating the effect of an explanatory variable on a model’s predictions (Chapters 18–19). detailed examination of both overall and instance-specific model performance (Chapter 20). These are residual-diagnostic tools that can help in identifying potential causes that may lead to issues with model performance. All those techniques can be used to evaluate the current version of a model and to get suggestions for possible improvements. The improvements may be developed and evaluated in the next crisp-modelling or fine-tuning phase. References "],
["doItYourselfWithR.html", "3 Do-it-yourself with R 3.1 What to install? 3.2 How to work with DALEX? 3.3 How to work with archivist?", " 3 Do-it-yourself with R In this book, we introduce various methods for instance-level and dataset-level exploration and explanation of predictive models. In each chapter, there is a section with code snippets for R and Python that shows how to use a particular method. In this chapter, we provide a short description of steps that are needed to set-up the R environment with the required libraries. 3.1 What to install? Obviously, the R software (R Core Team 2018) is needed. It is always a good idea to use the newest version. At least R in version 3.6 is recommended. It can be downloaded from the CRAN website https://cran.r-project.org/. A good editor makes working with R much easier. There is a plenty of choices, but, especially for beginners, it is worth considering the RStudio editor, an open-source and enterprise-ready tool for R. It can be downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/. Once R and the editor are available, the required packages should be installed. The most important one is the DALEX package in version 1.0 or newer. It is the entry point to solutions introduced in this book. The package can be installed by executing the following command from the R command line: install.packages(&quot;DALEX&quot;) Installation of DALEX will automatically take care about installation of other requirements (packages required by it), like the ggplot2 package for data visualization, ingredients and iBreakDown with specific methods for model exploration. 3.2 How to work with DALEX? To conduct model exploration with DALEX, first, a model has to be created. Then the model has got to be prepared for exploration. There are many packages in R that can be used to construct a model. Some packages are algorithm-specific, like randomForest for random-forest classification and regression models (Liaw and Wiener 2002), gbm for generalized boosted regression models (Ridgeway 2017), extensions for generalized linear models (Harrell Jr 2018), and many others. There is also a number of packages that can be used for constructing models with different algorithm These include the h2o package (LeDell et al. 2019), caret (Jed Wing et al. 2016) and its successor parsnip (Kuhn and Vaughan 2019), a very powerful and extensible framework mlr (Bischl et al. 2016), or keras that is a wrapper to Python library with the same name (Allaire and Chollet 2019). While it is great to have such a large choice of tools for constructing models, the disadvantage is that different packages have different interfaces and different arguments. Moreover, model-objects created with different packages may have different internal structures. The main goal of the DALEX package is to create a level of abstraction around a model that makes it easier to explore and explain the model. Function DALEX::explain is THE function for model wrapping. There is only one argument that is required by the function; it is model, which is used to specify the model-object with the fitted form of the model. However, the function allows additional arguments that extend its functionalities. They will be discussed in Section 5.2.6. Figure 3.1: The DALEX package creates a layer of abstraction around the models, allowing you to work with different models in a uniform way. The key function is the explain function, which wraps any model into a uniform interface. Then other functions from DALEX package can be used on the resulting object to explore the model. 3.3 How to work with archivist? As we will focus on exploration of predictive models, we prefer not to waste space nor time on replication of the code necessary for model development. This is where the archivist packages helps. The archivist package (Biecek and Kosinski 2017) is designed to store, share, and manage R objects. We will use it to easily access pretrained R models and precalculated explainers. To install the package, the following command should be executed in the R command line: install.packages(&quot;archivist&quot;) Once the package has been installed, function aread() can be used to retrieve R objects from any remote repository. For this book, we use a GitHub repository models hosted at https://github.com/pbiecek/models. For instance, to download a model with the md5 hash ceb40, the following command has to be executed: archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/ceb40&quot;) Since the md5 hash ceb40 uniquely defines the model, referring to the repository object results in using exactly the same model and the same explanations. Thus, in the subsequent chapters, pre-constructed models will be accessed with archivist hooks. In the following sections we will also use archivist hooks when referring to datasets. References "],

The Python interpreter (Van Rossum and Drake 2009) is needed. It is always a good idea to use the newest version. At least Python in version 3.6 is recommended. It can be downloaded from the Python website https://python.org/. A popular environment for simple python installation and configuration is Anaconda, which can be downloaded from website https://www.anaconda.com/. There are many editors available for Python to edit the code in a convenient way. In the data scientist community a very popular solution is The Jupyter Notebook. It is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code and, visualizations and descriptions. The Jupyter Notebook can be installed from the website https://jupyter.org/. Once Python and the editor are available, the required packages should be installed. The most important one is the dalex package currently in version 0.1.9. The package can be installed with pip by executing the following instruction from the command line: pip install dalex Installation of dalex will automatically take care about other required libraries. 4.2 How to work with dalex? There are many libraries in Python that can be used to construct a predictive model. Among the most popular one needs to name algorithm-specific libraries, like catboost (Dorogush, Ershov, and Gulin 2018), xgboost (Chen and Guestrin 2016), keras (Chollet and others 2015) of algorithm agnostic libraries like scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011). While it is great to have such a large choice of tools for constructing models, the disadvantage is that different packages have different interfaces and different arguments. Moreover, model-objects created with different packages may have different internal structures. The main goal of the dalex package is to create a level of abstraction around a model that makes it easier to explore and explain the model. Constructor Explainer() is THE method for model wrapping. There is only one argument that is required by the function; it is model, which is used to specify the model-object with the fitted form of the model. However, the function allows additional arguments that extend its functionalities. They will be discussed in Section 5.3.6. As soon as the model is packaged by the Explainer object, all further functions will be performed on this object. They will be presented in subsections Code snippets for Python. 4.3 Code snippets for Python A detailed description of the model exploration will be presented in the next chapters. In general, however, the way of working with the dalex library can be described in three steps: 1. Construction of the wrapper around the model, 2. calculation of the explanation and 3. plotting the explanation. # 1. create an explainer exp = dx.Explainer(model, X, y) # calculate predictions exp.predict(henry) # 2. calculate explanation obs_bd = exp.predict_parts(obs, type=&#39;break_down&#39;) # print explanation obs_bd # 3. plot explanation obs_bd.plot() References "],

The first dataset will be used to illustrate the application of the techniques in the case of classification predictive models for a binary dependent variable. This dataset is mainly used in the examples in the part II of this book. The second one will offer an example for regression models for a continuous variable. This dataset is mainly used in the examples in the part III of this book. The third dataset will be introduced in Chapter 21 to summarise all techniques introduced in the book. In this chapter, we provide a short description of first two datasets, together with results of exploratory analyses. We also introduce models that will be used for illustration purposes in subsequent chapters. 5.1 Sinking of the RMS Titanic Titanic sinking by Willy Stöwer Sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history (during peacetime). Over 1500 people died as a consequence of collision with an iceberg. Projects like Encyclopedia titanica (https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/) are a source of rich and precise data about Titanic’s passengers. The stablelearner package in R includes a data frame with information about passengers’ characteristics. The dataset, after some data cleaning and variable transformations, is also available in the DALEX package for R and dalex library for Python. In particular, the titanic data frame contains 2207 observations (for 1317 passengers and 890 crew members) and nine variables: gender, person’s (passenger’s or crew member’s) gender, a factor (categorical variable) with two levels (categories): “male” (78%) and “female” (22%); age, person’s age in years, a numerical variable; the age is given in (integer) years, in the range of 0–74 years; class, the class in which the passenger travelled, or the duty class of a crew member; a factor with seven levels: “1st” (14.7%), “2nd” (12.9%), “3rd” (32.1%), “deck crew” (3%), “engineering crew” (14.7%), “restaurant staff” (3.1%), and “victualling crew” (19.5%); embarked, the harbor in which the person embarked on the ship, a factor with four levels: “Belfast” (8.9%), “Cherbourg” (12.3%), “Queenstown” (5.6%), and “Southampton” (73.2%); country, person’s home country, a factor with 48 levels; the most common levels are “England” (51%), “United States” (12%), “Ireland” (6.2%), and “Sweden” (4.8%); fare, the price of the ticket (only available for passengers; 0 for crew members), a numerical variable in the range of 0–512; sibsp, the number of siblings/spouses aboard the ship, a numerical variable in the range of 0–8; parch, the number of parents/children aboard the ship, a numerical variable in the range of 0–9; survived, a factor with two levels: “yes” (67.8%) and “no” (32.2%) indicating whether the person survived or not. See an first six rows of this dataset in the Table below. gender age class embarked country fare sibsp parch survived male 42 3rd Southampton United States 7.11 0 0 no male 13 3rd Southampton United States 20.05 0 2 no male 16 3rd Southampton United States 20.05 1 1 no female 39 3rd Southampton England 20.05 1 1 yes female 16 3rd Southampton Norway 7.13 0 0 yes male 25 3rd Southampton United States 7.13 0 0 yes Models considered for this dataset will use survived as the (binary) dependent variable. 5.1.1 Data exploration As discussed in Chapter 2, it is always advisable to explore data before modelling. However, as this book is focused on model exploration, we will limit the data exploration part. Before exploring the data, we first conduct some pre-processing. In particular, the value of variables age, country, sibsp, parch, and fare is missing for a limited number of observations (2, 81, 10, 10, and 26, respectively). Analyzing data with missing values is a topic on its own (Schafer 1997; Little and Rubin 2002; Molenberghs and Kenward 2007). An often-used approach is to impute the missing values. Toward this end, multiple imputation should be considered (Schafer 1997; Molenberghs and Kenward 2007; Buuren 2012). However, given the limited number of missing values and the intended illustrative use of the dataset, we will limit ourselves to, admittedly inferior, single imputation. In particular, we replace the missing age values by the mean of the observed ones, i.e., 30. Missing country is encoded by \"X\". For sibsp and parch, we replace the missing values by the most frequently observed value, i.e., 0. Finally, for fare, we use the mean fare for a given class, i.e., 0 pounds for crew, 89 pounds for the 1st, 22 pounds for the 2nd, and 13 pounds for the 3rd class. After imputing the missing values, we investigate the association between survival status and other variables. Most variables in the Titanic dataset are categorical, except age and fare. In order to keep the exploration uniform, we first transformed them into categorical variables. Figure 5.1 shows histograms for both variables. Age is discretized into five categories resulting from cutoffs equal to 5, 10, 20, and 30, while fare is discretized by applying cutoffs equal to 1, 10, 25, and 50. Figure 5.1: Histograms for variables age and fare for the Titanic data. Figures 5.2–5.5 present graphically the proportion of non- and survivors for different levels of the other variables with the use of mosaic plots. The width of the bars (on the x-axis) reflects the marginal distribution (proportions) of the observed levels of the variable. On the other hand, the height of the bars (on the y-axis) provides the information about the proportion of non- and survivors. The graphs for age and fare were constructed by using the categorized versions of the variables. Figure 5.2 indicates that the proportion of survivors was larger for females and children below 5 years of age. This is most likely the result of the “women and children first” principle that is often evoked in situations that require evacuation of persons whose life is in danger. Figure 5.2: Survival according to gender and age category in the Titanic data. The principle can, perhaps, partially explain the trend seen in Figure 5.3, i.e., a higher proportion of survivors among those with 1-2 parents/children and 1-2 siblings/spouses aboard. Figure 5.3: Survival according to the number of parents/children and siblings/spouses in the Titanic data. Figure 5.4 indicates that passengers travelling in the first and second class had a higher chance of survival, perhaps due to the proximity of the location of their cabins to the deck. Interestingly, the proportion of survivors among crew deck was similar to the proportion of the first-class passengers. The figure also shows that the proportion of survivors increased with the fare, which is consistent with the fact that the proportion was higher for passengers travelling in the first and second class. Figure 5.4: Survival according to travel-class and ticket-fare in the Titanic data. Finally, Figure 5.5 does not suggest any noteworthy trends. Figure 5.5: Survival according to the embarked harbor and country in the Titanic data. 5.2 R classification models for Titanic 5.2.1 Logistic-regression model The dependent variable of interest, survived, is binary. Thus, a natural choice is to start the predictive modelling with a logistic-regression model. As there is no reason to expect a linear relationship between age and odds of survival, we use linear tail-restricted cubic splines, available in the rcs() function of the rms package (Harrell Jr 2018), to model the effect of age. We also do not expect linear relation for the fare variable, but because of its skewness (see Figure 5.1), we do not use splines for this variable. The results of the model are stored in model-object titanic_lmr, which will be used in subsequent chapters. library(&quot;rms&quot;) titanic_lmr &lt;- lrm(survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ gender + rcs(age) + class + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, titanic) titanic_lmr ## Logistic Regression Model ## ## lrm(formula = survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ gender + rcs(age) + class + ## sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic) ## ## Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim. ## Ratio Test Indexes Indexes ## Obs 2207 LR chi2 752.06 R2 0.404 C 0.817 ## FALSE 1496 d.f. 17 g 1.647 Dxy 0.635 ## TRUE 711 Pr(&gt; chi2) &lt;0.0001 gr 5.191 gamma 0.636 ## max |deriv| 0.0001 gp 0.282 tau-a 0.277 ## Brier 0.146 ## ## Coef S.E.

This is why we do not split the data into the training and testing subsets. Instead, the model is fitted to the entire dataset and will be examined on the same dataset. 5.2.2 Random-forest model As an alternative to the logistic-regression model we consider a random-forest model. Random-forest modelling is known for good predictive performance, ability to grasp low-order variable interactions, and stability (Leo Breiman 2001a). To fit the model, we apply the randomForest() function, with default settings, from the package with the same name (Liaw and Wiener 2002). In the first instance, we fit a model with the same set of explanatory variables as the logistic-regression model (see Section 5.2.1). The results of the random-forest model are stored in model-object titanic_rf. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) set.seed(1313) titanic_rf &lt;- randomForest(survived ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic) titanic_rf ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = survived ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic) ## Type of random forest: classification ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 2 ## ## OOB estimate of error rate: 18.62% ## Confusion matrix: ## no yes class.error ## no 1393 103 0.06885027 ## yes 308 403 0.43319269 5.2.3 Gradient-boosting model Additionally, we consider the gradient-boosting model (Friedman 2000). Tree-based-boosting models are known for being able to accommodate higher-order interactions between variables. We use the same set of six explanatory variables as for the logistic-regression model (see Section 5.2.1). To fit the gradient-boosting model, we use function gbm() from the gbm package (Ridgeway 2017). The results of the model are stored in model-object titanic_gbm. library(&quot;gbm&quot;) set.seed(1313) titanic_gbm &lt;- gbm(survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic, n.trees = 15000, distribution = &quot;bernoulli&quot;) titanic_gbm ## gbm(formula = survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + ## parch + fare + embarked, distribution = &quot;bernoulli&quot;, data = titanic, ## n.trees = 15000) ## A gradient boosted model with bernoulli loss function. ## 15000 iterations were performed. ## There were 7 predictors of which 7 had non-zero influence. 5.2.4 Support Vector Machine model for Classification Finally, we also consider a support vector machine model (Cortes and Vapnik 1995). We use the C-classification mode. Again, we fit a model with the same set of explanatory variables as in the logistic-regression model (see Section 5.2.1) To fit the model, we use function svm() from the e1071 package (Meyer et al. 2019). The results of the model are stored in model-object titanic_svm. library(&quot;e1071&quot;) titanic_svm &lt;- svm(survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic, type = &quot;C-classification&quot;, probability = TRUE) titanic_svm ## ## Call: ## svm(formula = survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + ## parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic, type = &quot;C-classification&quot;, ## probability = TRUE) ## ## ## Parameters: ## SVM-Type: C-classification ## SVM-Kernel: radial ## cost: 1 ## ## Number of Support Vectors: 1030 5.2.5 Models’ predictions Let us now compare predictions that are obtained from the different models. In particular, we compute the predicted probability of survival for Johnny D, an 8-year-old boy who embarked in Southampton and travelled in the first class with no parents nor siblings, and with a ticket costing 72 pounds. First, we create a dataframe johnny_d that contains the data describing the passenger. johnny_d &lt;- data.frame( class = factor(&quot;1st&quot;, levels = c(&quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;deck crew&quot;, &quot;engineering crew&quot;, &quot;restaurant staff&quot;, &quot;victualling crew&quot;)), gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;)), age = 8, sibsp = 0, parch = 0, fare = 72, embarked = factor(&quot;Southampton&quot;, levels = c(&quot;Belfast&quot;, &quot;Cherbourg&quot;,&quot;Queenstown&quot;,&quot;Southampton&quot;)) ) Subsequently, we use the generic function predict() to obtain the predicted probability of survival for the logistic-regression model. (pred_lmr &lt;- predict(titanic_lmr, johnny_d, type = &quot;fitted&quot;)) ## 1 ## 0.7677036 The predicted probability is equal to 0.77. We do the same for the remaining three models. (pred_rf &lt;- predict(titanic_rf, johnny_d, type = &quot;prob&quot;)) ## no yes ## 1 0.578 0.422 ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;array&quot; &quot;votes&quot; (pred_gbm &lt;- predict(titanic_gbm, johnny_d, type = &quot;response&quot;, n.trees = 15000)) ## [1] 0.6632574 (pred_svm &lt;- predict(titanic_svm, johnny_d, probability = TRUE)) ## 1 ## FALSE ## attr(,&quot;probabilities&quot;) ## FALSE TRUE ## 1 0.7799685 0.2200315 ## Levels: FALSE TRUE As a result, we obtain the predicted probabilities of 0.42, 0.66, and 0.22 for the random-forest, gradient-boosting, and support vector machine models, respectively. The models lead to different probabilities. Thus, it might be of interest to understand the reason for the differences, as it could help us to decide which of the predictions we might want to trust. We will investigate this issue in the subsequent chapters. Note that, for some examples later in the book, we will use another observation (instance) with lower chances of survival. We will call this passenger Henry. henry &lt;- data.frame( class = factor(&quot;1st&quot;, levels = c(&quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;deck crew&quot;, &quot;engineering crew&quot;, &quot;restaurant staff&quot;, &quot;victualling crew&quot;)), gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;)), age = 47, sibsp = 0, parch = 0, fare = 25, embarked = factor(&quot;Cherbourg&quot;, levels = c(&quot;Belfast&quot;, &quot;Cherbourg&quot;,&quot;Queenstown&quot;,&quot;Southampton&quot;)) ) predict(titanic_lmr, henry, type = &quot;fitted&quot;) ## 1 ## 0.4318245 predict(titanic_rf, henry, type = &quot;prob&quot;)[,2] ## [1] 0.246 predict(titanic_gbm, henry, type = &quot;response&quot;, n.trees = 15000) ## [1] 0.3073358 attr(predict(titanic_svm, henry, probability = TRUE),&quot;probabilities&quot;)[,2] ## [1] 0.1767995 5.2.6 Models’ explainers Model-objects created with different libraries may have different internal structures. Thus, first, we have got to create an “explainer,” i.e., an object that provides an uniform interface for different models. Toward this end, we use the explain() function from the DALEX package (Biecek 2018). As it was mentioned in Section 3.2, there is only one argument that is required by the function, i.e., model. The argument is used to specify the model-object with the fitted form of the model. However, the function allows additional arguments that extend its functionalities. In particular, the list of arguments includes the following: data, a data frame or matrix providing data to which the model is to be applied; if not provided (data = NULL by default), the data are extracted from the model-object. Note that the data object should not in principle, contain the dependent variable. y, observed values of the dependent variable corresponding to the data given in the data object; if not provided (y = NULL by default), the values are extracted from the model-object; predict_function, a function that returns prediction scores; if not specified (predict_function = NULL by default), then a default predict() function is used (note that this may lead to errors); residual_function, a function that returns model residuals; if not specified (residual_function = NULL by default), then model residuals defined in equation (2.1) are calculated; verbose, a logical argument (verbose = TRUE by default) indicating whether diagnostic messages are to be printed; precalculate, a logical argument (precalculate = TRUE by default) indicating whether predicted values and residuals are to be calculated when the explainer is created. Note that this will also happen if verbose = TRUE. To skip the calculations, both verbose and precalculate should be set to FALSE . model_info, a named list (with components “package,” “version,” and “type”) providing information about the model; if not specified (model_info = NULL by default), DALEX seeks for information on its own; type, information about the type of the model, either “classification” (for a binary dependent variable) or “regression” (for a continuous depenent variable); if not specified (type = NULL by default), then the value of the argument is extracted from model_info; label, a unique name of the model; if not specified (label = NULL by default), then it is extracted from class(model). Application of function explain() provides an object of class explainer. It is a list with many components that include: model, the explained model; data, the data to which the model is applied; y, observed values of the dependet variable corresponding to data; y_hat, predictions obtained by applying model to data; residuals, residuals computed based on y and y_hat; predict_function, the function used to obtain the model’s predictions; residual_function, the function used to obtain residuals; class, class/classes of the model; label, label of the model/explainer; model_info, a named list (with components package, version, and type) providing information about the model. Thus, each explainer-object contains all elements needed to create a model explanation. The code below creates explainers for the models (see Sections 5.2.1–5.2.4) fitted to the Titanic data. Note that, in the data argument, we indicate the titanic data frame without the ninth column, i.e., without the survived variable. The variable is used in the y argument to explicitly define the binary dependent variable equal to 1 for survivors and 0 for passengers who did not survive. titanic_lmr_exp &lt;- explain(model = titanic_lmr, data = titanic[, -9], y = titanic$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Logistic Regression&quot;) titanic_lmr_exp$model_info$type = &quot;classification&quot; titanic_rf_exp &lt;- explain(model = titanic_rf, data = titanic[, -9], y = titanic$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;) titanic_gbm_exp &lt;- explain(model = titanic_gbm, data = titanic[, -9], y = titanic$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Generalized Boosted Regression&quot;) titanic_svm_exp &lt;- explain(model = titanic_svm, data = titanic[, -9], y = titanic$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Support Vector Machine&quot;) 5.2.7 List of objects for the Titanic example In the previous sections, we have built four predictive models for the Titanic dataset. The models will be used in the rest of the book to illustrate model-explanation methods and tools. For the ease of reference, we summarize the models in Table 5.1. The binary model-objects can be downloaded by using the indicated archivist hooks (Biecek and Kosinski 2017). By calling a function specified in the last column of the table, one can restore a selected model in its local R environment. Table 5.1: Predictive models created for the titanic dataset.

The survived column is a target variable, the remaining columns will be used to construct the classifier. The following instructions load the titanic dataset and split it into the target variable y and the predictive variables X. For the purpose of this example we do not divide the data into training and testing data. Instructions on how to deal with the situation when you want to analyze the model on data other than training data will be presented in the next chapter. import dalex as dx titanic = dx.datasets.load_titanic() X = titanic.drop(columns=&#39;survived&#39;) y = titanic.survived Data X contains numeric variables with different ranges (e.g. age and fare) and categorical variables. Machine Learning algorithms in scikitlearn require the data to be preprocessed into numeric form. Therefore, before modeling, we prepared a pipeline that performs data preprocessing. That is scaling for continuous variables (age, fare, parch, sibsp) and one-hot-encoding for qualitative variables (gender, class, embarked). from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline preprocess = make_column_transformer( (StandardScaler(), [&#39;age&#39;, &#39;fare&#39;, &#39;parch&#39;, &#39;sibsp&#39;]), (OneHotEncoder(), [&#39;gender&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;embarked&#39;])) 5.3.1 Logistic-regression model The dependent variable of interest, survived, is binary. Thus, a natural choice is to start the predictive modelling with a logistic-regression model. Here we use the LogisticRegression algorithm from sklearn library. By default the sklearn implementation use ridge regression with \\(L_2\\) penalty for model coefficients. This is whay it was impotant to scale numerical valriables like age and fare. The result is a model stored in object titanic_lr, which will be used in subsequent chapters. from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression titanic_lr = make_pipeline( preprocess, LogisticRegression(penalty=&#39;l2&#39;)) titanic_lr.fit(X, y) Note that we are not very much interested in the assessment of the model’s predictive performance, but rather on understanding how does the model yield its predictions. This is why we do not split the data into the training and testing subsets. Instead, the model is fitted to the entire dataset and will be examined on the same dataset. 5.3.2 Random-forest model As an alternative to the logistic-regression model we consider a random-forest model. Random-forest modelling is known for good predictive performance, ability to grasp low-order variable interactions, and stability (Leo Breiman 2001a). To fit the model, we use RandomForestClassifier algorithm from sklearn library. We use the default settings with tree not deeper than 3 levels, and the number of trees in the random forest is set to 500. The result is a model stored in object model_rf, which will be used in subsequent chapters. from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier titanic_rf = make_pipeline( preprocess, RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=0, n_estimators=500)) titanic_rf.fit(X, y) 5.3.3 Gradient-boosting model Additionally, we consider the gradient-boosting model (Friedman 2000). Tree-based-boosting models are known for being able to accommodate higher-order interactions between variables. To fit the model, we use GradientBoostingClassifier algorithm from sklearn library. We use the default settings and the number of trees in the ensemble is set to 100. The result is a model stored in object model_gbc, which will be used in subsequent chapters. from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier titanic_gbc = make_pipeline( preprocess, GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100)) titanic_gbc.fit(X, y) 5.3.4 Support Vector Machine model for Classification Finally, we also consider a support vector machine model (Cortes and Vapnik 1995). We use the C-Support Vector Classification mode. To fit the model, we use SVC algorithm from sklearn library based on libsvm. The result is a model stored in object model_svm, which will be used in subsequent chapters. from sklearn.svm import SVC titanic_svm = make_pipeline( preprocess, SVC(probability=True)) titanic_svm.fit(X, y) 5.3.5 Models’ predictions Let us now compare predictions that are obtained from the different models. In particular, we compute the predicted probability of survival for Johnny D, an 8-year-old boy who embarked in Southampton and travelled in the first class with no parents nor siblings, and with a ticket costing 72 pounds. First, we create a dataframe johnny_d that contains the data describing the passenger. import pandas as pd johnny_d = pd.DataFrame({&#39;gender&#39;: [&#39;male&#39;], &#39;age&#39;: [8], &#39;class&#39;: [&#39;1st&#39;], &#39;embarked&#39;: [&#39;Southampton&#39;], &#39;fare&#39;: [72], &#39;sibsp&#39;: [0], &#39;parch&#39;: [0]}, index = [&#39;JohnnyD&#39;]) Subsequently, we use the method predict_proba() to obtain the predicted probability of survival for the logistic-regression model. titanic_lr.predict_proba(johnny_d) # array([[0.35884528, 0.64115472]]) We do the same for the remaining three models. titanic_rf.predict_proba(johnny_d) # array([[0.63028556, 0.36971444]]) titanic_gbc.predict_proba(johnny_d) # array([[0.1567194, 0.8432806]]) titanic_svm.predict_proba(johnny_d) # array([[0.78308146, 0.21691854]]) Note that, for some examples later in the book, we will use another observation (instance) with lower chances of survival. We will call this passenger Henry. henry = pd.DataFrame({&#39;gender&#39;: [&#39;male&#39;], &#39;age&#39;: [47], &#39;class&#39;: [&#39;1st&#39;], &#39;embarked&#39;: [&#39;Southampton&#39;], &#39;fare&#39;: [25], &#39;sibsp&#39;: [0], &#39;parch&#39;: [0]}, index = [&#39;Henry&#39;]) titanic_lr.predict_proba(henry) # array([[0.69547744, 0.30452256]]) titanic_rf.predict_proba(henry) # array([[0.73060059, 0.26939941]]) titanic_gbc.predict_proba(henry) # array([[0.1567194, 0.8432806]]) titanic_svm.predict(henry) # array([[0.82429369, 0.17570631]]) 5.3.6 Models’ explainers The examples that we show in this chapter are based on the sklearn library, which makes it possible to work with models in a uniform way. But often we also want to work with models built in other libraries. To make it easier to work models with different structures, the dalex library wraps models in the objects of the class Explainer, that have all the necessary functions of the model available in a uniform way. There is only one argument that is required by the function, i.e., model. However, the function allows additional arguments that extend its functionalities. In particular, the list of arguments includes the following: data, a data frame or matrix providing data to which the model is to be applied. y, observed values of the dependent variable corresponding to the data given in the data object; predict_function, a function that returns prediction scores; if not specified, then dalex will make a guess which function shall be used, predict(), predict_proba() or something else; residual_function, a function that returns model residuals; label, a unique name of the model; model_class, class of actual model; verbose, a logical argument (verbose = TRUE by default) indicating whether diagnostic messages are to be printed; model_type, information about the type of the model, either “classification” (for a binary dependent variable) or “regression” (for a continuous dependent variable); model_info, a dictionary with additional information about the model. Application of constructor Explainer() provides an object of class “Explainer”. It is an object with many components that include: model, the explained model; data, the data to which the model is applied; y, observed values of the dependet variable corresponding to data; y_hat, predictions obtained by applying model to ’data`; residuals, residuals computed based on y and y_hat; predict_function, the function used to obtain the model’s predictions; residual_function, the function used to obtain residuals; class, class/classes of the model; label, label of the model/Explainer; model_info, a dictionary (with components “package,” “version,” and “type”) providing information about the model. Thus, each Explainer-object contains all elements needed to create a model explanation. The code below creates explainers for the models (see Sections 5.3.1–5.3.4) fitted to the Titanic data. titanic_rf_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_rf, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic RF Pipeline&quot;) titanic_lr_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_lr, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic LR Pipeline&quot;) titanic_gbc_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_gbc, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic XGB Pipeline&quot;) titanic_svm_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_svm, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic SVM Pipeline&quot;) 5.4 Apartment prices Warsaw skyscrapers by Artur Malinowski Flicker Predicting house prices is a common exercise used in machine-learning courses. Various datasets for house prices are available at websites like Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com) or UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu). In this book, we will work with an interesting variant of this problem. The apartments dataset is an artificial dataset created to match key characteristics of real apartments in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. However, the dataset is created in a way that two very different models, namely linear regression and random forest, have almost exactly the same accuracy. The natural question is then: which model should we choose? We will show that the model-explanation tools provide important insight into the key model characteristics and are helpful in model selection. The dataset is available in the DALEX package for R and dalex library for Python. It contains 1000 observations (apartments) and six variables: m2.price, apartment’s price per square meter (in EUR), a numerical variable in the range of 1607–6595; construction.year, the year of construction of the block of flats in which the apartment is located, a numerical variable in the range of 1920–2010; surface, apartment’s total surface in square meters, a numerical variable in the range of 20–150; floor, the floor at which the apartment is located (ground floor taken to be the first floor), a numerical integer variable with values ranging from 1 to 10; no.rooms, the total number of rooms, a numerical integer variable with values ranging from 1 to 6; district, a factor with 10 levels indicating the district of Warsaw where the apartment is located. See an first six rows of this dataset in the Table below. m2.price construction.year surface floor no.rooms district 5897 1953 25 3 1 Srodmiescie 1818 1992 143 9 5 Bielany 3643 1937 56 1 2 Praga 3517 1995 93 7 3 Ochota 3013 1992 144 6 5 Mokotow 5795 1926 61 6 2 Srodmiescie Models considered for this dataset will use m2.price as the (continuous) dependent variable. Models’ predictions will be validated on a set of 9000 apartments included in data frame apartments_test. Note that usually, the testing data is smaller than the training data. In this example we deliberately use a small training set so that model selection is not too easy. After all, it’s just an use-case. 5.4.1 Data exploration Note that apartments is an artificial dataset created to illustrate and explain differences between random forest and linear regression. Hence, the structure of the data, the form and strength of association between variables, plausibility of distributional assumptions, etc., is better than in a real-life dataset. In fact, all these characteristics of the data are known. Nevertheless, we present some data exploration below to illustrate the important aspects of the data. The variable of interest is m2.price, the price per square meter. The histogram presented in Figure 5.6 indicates that the distribution of the variable is slightly skewed to the right. Figure 5.6: Distribution of the price per square meter in the apartment-prices data. Figure 5.7 suggests (possibly) a non-linear relationship between construction.year and m2.price and a linear relation between surface and m2.price. Figure 5.7: Apartment-prices data. Price per square meter vs. year of construction (left-hand-side panel) and vs. surface (right-hand-side panel). Figure 5.8 indicates that the relationship between floor and m2.price is also close to linear, as well as is the association between no.rooms and m2.price . Figure 5.8: Apartment-prices data. Price per square meter vs. floor (left-hand-side panel) and vs. number of rooms (right-hand-side panel). Figure 5.9 shows that surface and number of rooms are positively associatied and that prices depend on district. In particular, box plots in Figure 5.9 indicate that the highest prices per square meter are observed in Srodmiescie (Downtown). Figure 5.9: Apartment-prices data. Surface vs. number of rooms (left-hand-side panel) and price per square meter for different districts (right-hand-side panel). 5.5 R regression model for Apartment prices 5.5.1 Linear-regression model The dependent variable of interest, m2.price, is continuous. Thus, a natural choice to build a predictive model is linear regression. We treat all the other variables in the apartments data frame as explanatory and include them in the model. To fit the model, we apply the lm() function. The results of the model are stored in model-object apartments_lm. apartments_lm &lt;- lm(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments) anova(apartments_lm) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: m2.price ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## construction.year 1 2629802 2629802 33.233 1.093e-08 *** ## surface 1 207840733 207840733 2626.541 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## floor 1 79823027 79823027 1008.746 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## no.rooms 1 956996 956996 12.094 0.000528 *** ## district 9 451993980 50221553 634.664 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## Residuals 986 78023123 79131 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 5.5.2 Random-forest model As an alternative to linear regression, we consider a random-forest model. Again, we treat all the variables in the apartments data frame other than m2.price as explanatory and include them in the model. To fit the model, we apply the randomForest() function, with default settings, from the package with the same name (Liaw and Wiener 2002). The results of the model are stored in model-object apartments_rf. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) set.seed(72) apartments_rf &lt;- randomForest(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments) apartments_rf ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = m2.price ~ ., data = apartments) ## Type of random forest: regression ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 1 ## ## Mean of squared residuals: 79789.39 ## % Var explained: 90.28 5.5.3 Support Vector Machine model for Regression Finally, we consider a support vector machine model, with all the variables in the apartments data frame other than m2.price treated as explanatory. To fit the model, we use the svm() function, with default settings, from package e1071 (Meyer et al. 2017). The results of the model are stored in model-object apartments_svm. library(&quot;e1071&quot;) apartments_svm &lt;- svm(m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + no.rooms + district, data = apartments) apartments_svm ## ## Call: ## svm(formula = m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + no.rooms + ## district, data = apartments) ## ## ## Parameters: ## SVM-Type: eps-regression ## SVM-Kernel: radial ## cost: 1 ## gamma: 0.07142857 ## epsilon: 0.1 ## ## ## Number of Support Vectors: 536 5.5.4 Models’ predictions The predict() function calculates predictions for a specific model. In the example below, we use model-objects apartments_lm, apartments_rf, and apartments_svm, to calculate predictions for prices of the apartments from the apartments_test data frame. Note that, for brevity sake, we compute the predictions only for the first six observations from the data frame. Actual prices for the six observations from apartments_test. apartments_test$m2.price[1:6] ## [1] 4644 3082 2498 2735 2781 2936 Predictions with linear regression. predict(apartments_lm, apartments_test[1:6,]) ## 1001 1002 1003 1004 1005 1006 ## 4820.009 3292.678 2717.910 2922.751 2974.086 2527.043 Predictions with random-forest model. predict(apartments_rf, apartments_test[1:6,]) ## 1001 1002 1003 1004 1005 1006 ## 4214.084 3178.061 2695.787 2744.775 2951.069 2999.450 Predictions with support vector model. predict(apartments_svm, apartments_test[1:6,]) ## 1001 1002 1003 1004 1005 1006 ## 4590.076 3012.044 2369.748 2712.456 2681.777 2750.904 By using the code below, we summarize the predictive performance of the linear-regression and random-forest models by computing the square root of the mean-squared-error (RMSE). For a “perfect” predictive model, which would predict all observations exactly, RMSE should be equal to 0. More information about RMSE can be found in Section 16.3.1. predicted_apartments_lm &lt;- predict(apartments_lm, apartments_test) (rmsd_lm &lt;- sqrt(mean((predicted_apartments_lm - apartments_test$m2.price)^2))) ## [1] 283.0865 predicted_apartments_rf &lt;- predict(apartments_rf, apartments_test) (rmsd_rf &lt;- sqrt(mean((predicted_apartments_rf - apartments_test$m2.price)^2))) ## [1] 282.9519 For the random-forest model, RMSE is equal to 283. It is almost identical to the RMSE for the linear-regression model, which is equal to 283.1. Thus, the question we may face is: should we choose the more complex, but flexible random-forest model, or the simpler and easier to interpret linear-regression model? In the subsequent chapters we will try to provide an answer to this question. In particular, we will show that a proper model exploration may help to discover weak and strong sides of any of the models and, in consequence, allow creation of a new model, with a better performance than either of the two. 5.5.5 Models’ explainers The code below creates explainers for the models (see Sections 5.5.1–5.5.3) fitted to the apartment-prices data. Note that we use the apartments_test data frame without the first column, i.e., the m2.price variable, in the data argument. This will be the dataset to which the model will be applied (see Section 5.2.6). The m2.price variable is explicitly specified as the dependent variable in the y argument (see Section 5.2.6). apartments_lm_exp &lt;- explain(model = apartments_lm, data = apartments_test[,-1], y = apartments_test$m2.price, label = &quot;Linear Regression&quot;) apartments_rf_exp &lt;- explain(model = apartments_rf, data = apartments_test[,-1], y = apartments_test$m2.price, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;) apartments_svm_exp &lt;- explain(model = apartments_svm, data = apartments_test[,-1], y = apartments_test$m2.price, label = &quot;Support Vector Machine&quot;) 5.5.6 List of objects for the Apartment prices example In Sections 5.5.1–5.5.3, we have built three predictive models for the apartments dataset. The models will be used in the rest of the book to illustrate the model-explanation methods and tools. For the ease of reference, we summarize the models in Table 5.3. The binary model-objects can be downloaded by using the indicated archivist hooks (Biecek and Kosinski 2017). By calling a function specified in the last column of the table, one can restore a selected model in a local R environment. Table 5.3: Predictive models created for the dataset Apartment prices.

The m2_price column is a target variable, the remaining columns will be used to construct the predictive model. The following instructions load the apartmets dataset and split it into the target variable y and the predictive variables X. import dalex as dx apartmets = dx.datasets.load_apartmets() X = apartmets.drop(columns=&#39;m2_price&#39;) y = apartmets.m2_price Data X contains numeric variables with different ranges (e.g. surface and no.rooms) and categorical variables (i.e. district). Machine Learning algorithms in sklearn require the data to be preprocessed into numeric form. Therefore, before modeling, we prepared a pipeline that performs data preprocessing. That is scaling for continuous variables (construction.year, surface, floor, no.rooms) and one-hot-encoding for categorical variables (district). from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline preprocess = make_column_transformer( (StandardScaler(), [&#39;construction.year&#39;, &#39;surface&#39;, &#39;floor&#39;, &#39;no.rooms&#39;]), (OneHotEncoder(), [&#39;district&#39;])) 5.6.1 Linear-regression model The dependent variable of interest, m2.price, is continuous. Thus, a natural choice to build a predictive model is linear regression. We treat all the other variables in the apartments data frame as explanatory and include them in the model. Here we use the LinearRegression algorithm from sklearn library. The result is a model stored in object apartments_lm, which will be used in subsequent chapters. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression apartments_lm = make_pipeline( preprocess, LinearRegression()) apartments_lm.fit(X, y) 5.6.2 Random-forest model As an alternative to linear regression, we consider a random-forest model. Again, we treat all the variables in the apartments data frame other than m2.price as explanatory and include them in the model. To fit the model, we use RandomForestRegressor algorithm from sklearn library. We use the default settings with tree not deeper than 3 levels, and the number of trees in the random forest is set to 500. The result is a model stored in object apartments_rf, which will be used in subsequent chapters. from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor apartments_rf = make_pipeline( preprocess, RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=0, n_estimators=500)) apartments_rf.fit(X, y) 5.6.3 Support Vector Machine model for Regression Finally, we also consider a support vector machine model (Cortes and Vapnik 1995). We use the Support Vector for Regression with linear kernel. To fit the model, we use SVR algorithm from sklearn library. The result is a model stored in object apartments_svm, which will be used in subsequent chapters. from sklearn.svm import SVR apartments_svm = make_pipeline( preprocess, SVR()) apartments_svm.fit(X, y) 5.6.4 Models’ predictions Let us now compare predictions that are obtained from the different models. Subsequently, we use the method predict() to obtain the predicted price of square metter for the linear regression model. apartments_lr.predict(apartments_test) We do the same for the remaining two models. apartments_rf.predict(apartments_test) apartments_svm.predict(apartments_test) 5.6.5 Models’ explainers The examples that we show in this chapter are based on the sklearn library, which makes it possible to work with models in a uniform way. But often we also want to work with models built in other libraries. To make it easier to work models with different structures, the dalex library wraps models in the objects of the class Explainer, that have all the necessary functions of the model available in a uniform way. More detailed description is given in Section 5.3.6. apartments_lr_exp = dx.Explainer(apartments_lr, X, y, label = &quot;Apartments LR Pipeline&quot;) apartments_rf_exp = dx.Explainer(apartments_rf, X, y, label = &quot;Apartments RF Pipeline&quot;) apartments_svm_exp = dx.Explainer(apartments_svm, X, y, label = &quot;Apartments SVM Pipeline&quot;) References "],
["InstanceLevelExploration.html", "6 Introduction to Instance-level Exploration", " 6 Introduction to Instance-level Exploration Instance-level exploration methods help to understand how does a model yield a prediction for a particular single observation. We can think about the following situations as examples: We may want to evaluate effects of explanatory variables on the model’s predictions. For instance, we may be interested in predicting the risk of heart attack based on person’s age, sex, and smoking habits. A model may be used to construct a score (for instance, a linear combination of the explanatory variables representing age, sex, and smoking habits) that could be used for the purposes of prediction. For a particular patient we may want to learn how much do the different variables contribute to the score? We may want to understand how would the model’s predictions change if values of some of the explanatory variables changed? For instance, what would be the predicted risk of heart attack if the patient cut the number of cigarettes smoked per day by half? We may discover that the model is providing incorrect predictions and we may want to find the reason. For instance, a patient with a very low risk-score experienced a heart attack. What has driven the wrong prediction? In this part of the book we describe the most popular approaches to instance-level exploration. They can be divided into three classes: One approach is to analyze how does the model’s prediction for a particular instance differ from the average prediction and how can the difference be distributed among explanatory variables? This method is often called the “variable attributions” approach. An example is provided in panel A of Figure 6.1. Chapters 7-9 present various methods implementing this approach. Another approach uses the interpretation of the model as a function and investigates the local behavior of this function around the point (observation) of interest \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). In particular, we analyze the curvature of the model response (prediction) surface around \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). In case of a black-box model, we may approximate it with a simpler glass-box model around \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). An example is provided in panel B of Figure 6.1. Chapter 10 presents the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method that exploits the concept of a “local model.” Yet another approach is to investigate how does the model’s prediction change if the value of a single explanatory variable changes? The approach is useful in the so-called “What-if” analyses. In particular, we can construct plots presenting the change in model-based predictions induced by a change of a single explanatory variable. Such plots are usually called ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles. An example is provided in panel C in Figure 6.1. Chapters 11-13 introduce the CP profiles and methods based on them. Each method has its own merits and limitations. They are briefly discussed in the corresponding chapters. Chapter 14 offers a comparison of the methods. Figure 6.1: Illustration of different approaches to instance-level exploration. The plots present response (prediction) surface for a (black-box) model that is a function of two explanatory variables. We are interested in understanding the model response (prediction) at a single point (observation). Panel A illustrates the concept of variable attributions. Additive effect of each variable show how does the prediction for the particular observation differ from the average. Panel B illustrates the concept of explanations through local models. A simpler glass-box model is used to approximate the black-box model around the point (observation) of interest. It describes the local behavior of the model. Panel C presents a “What-if” analysis with a ceteris-paribus profile. The profile shows the model response (prediction) as a function of a single explanatory variable, while keeping the values of all other explanatory variables fixed. "],

There is no single best approach that can be used to answer this question. In this chapter, we introduce break-down (BD) plots, which offer a possible solution. The plots can be used to present “variable attributions,” i.e., the decomposition of the model’s prediction into contributions that can be attributed to different explanatory variables. Note that the method is similar to the EXPLAIN algorithm introduced by Robnik-Šikonja and Kononenko (2008) and implemented in the ExplainPrediction package (Robnik-Šikonja 2018). 7.2 Intuition As mentioned in Section 2.5, we assume that prediction \\(f(\\underline{x})\\) is an approximation of the expected value of the dependent variable \\(Y\\) given values of explanatory variables \\(\\underline{x}\\). The underlying idea of BD plots is to capture the contribution of an explanatory variable to the model’s prediction by computing the shift in the expected value of \\(Y\\), while fixing the values of other variables. This idea is illustrated in Figure 7.1. Consider an example related to the prediction obtained for the random-forest model model_rf for the Titanic data (see Section 5.2.2). We are interested in the probability of survival for Johnny D, an 8-years-old passenger travelling in the first class (see Section 5.2.5). Panel A of Figure 7.1 shows distribution of the model’s predictions for observations from the Titanic dataset. In particular, the violin plot in the row marked “all data” summarizes the distrbution of predictions for all 2207 observations from the dataset. The red dot indicates the mean value that can be interpreted as an estimate of the expected value of the model’s predictions over the distribution of all explanatory variables. In this example, the mean value is equal to 23.5%. Figure 7.1: Break-down plots show how the contributions attributed to individual explanatory variables change the mean model’s prediction to yield the actual prediction for a particular single instance (observation). Panel A) The first row shows the distribution and the mean value (red dot) of model’s predictions for all data. The next rows show the distribution and the mean value of the predictions when fixing values of subsequent explanatory variables. The last row shows the prediction for the particular instance of interest. B) Red dots indicate the mean predictions from panel A. C) The green and red bars indicate, respectively, positive and negative changes in the mean predictions (contributions attributed to explanatory variables). To evaluate the contribution of individual explanatory variables to this particular single-instance prediction, we investigate the changes in the model’s predictions when fixing the values of consecutive variables. For instance, the violin plot in the row marked “age=8” in panel A of Figure 7.1 summarizes the distribution of the predictions obtained when the age variable takes the value “8 years”, as for Johnny D. Again, the red dot indicates the mean of the predictions and it can be interpreted as an estimate of the expected value of the predictions over the distribution of all explanatory variables other than class. The violin plot in the “class=1st” row describes the distribution and the mean value of predictions with the values of variables age and class set to “8 years” and “1st class”, respectively. Subsequent rows contain similar information for other explanatory variables included in the random-forest model. In the last row, all explanatory variables are fixed at the values describing Johnny D. Hence, the last row contains only one point, the red dot, which corresponds to the model’s prediction, i.e., survival probability, for Johnny D. The thin grey lines in panel A of Figure 7.1 show the change of predictions for different individuals when the value of a particular explanatory variable is being replaced by the value indicated in the name of the row. For instance, the lines between the first and the second row indicate that fixing the value of the age variable to “8 years” has a different effect for different individuals. For some individuals (most likely, passengers that are 8 years old) the model’s prediction does not change at all. For others, the predicted value increases (probably for the passengers older than 8 years) or decreases (most likely for the passengers younger than 8 years). Eventually, however, we may be interested in the mean predictions, or even only in the changes of the means. Thus, simplified plots, similar to those shown in panels B and C of Figure 7.1, may be of interest. Note that, in panel C, the row marked “intercept” presents the overall mean value (0.235) of predictions for the entire dataset. Consecutive rows present changes in the mean prediction induced by fixing the value of a particular explanatory variable. Positive changes are indicated with green bars, while negative differences are indicated with red bars. The last row, marked “prediction,” contains the sum of the overall mean value and the changes, i.e., the predicted value of survival probability for Johnny D, indicated by the blue bar. What can be learned from BD plots as those presented in Figure 7.1? The plots offer a summary of effects of a particular explanatory variables on a model’s predictions. From Figure 7.1 we can conclude, for instance, that the mean model’s prediction for the random-forest model for the Titanic dataset is equal to 23.5 percent. This is the predicted probability of survival averaged over all people on Titanic. Note that it is not the percentage of inidividuals that survived, but the mean model-prediction. Thus, for a different model, we would most likely obtain a different mean value. The model’s prediction for Johnny D is equal to 42.2 percent. It is much higher than the mean prediction. The two explanatory variables that influence this prediction the most are class (with the value “1st”) and age (with the value equal to 8). By fixing the values of these two variables, we add 35.6 percentage points to the mean prediction. All other explanatory variables have smaller effects and they actually reduce the increase in the predicted value induced by class an age. For instance, gender (Johnny D was a boy) reduces the predicted surival probability by about 8.3 percentage points. It is worth noting that the part of the prediction attributed to an explanatory variable depends not only on the variable, but also on the considered value. For instance, in the example presented in Figure 7.1, the effect of the embarked harbor is very small. This may be due to the fact that the variable is not very important for prediction. However, it is also possible that the variable is important, but the effect of the value considered for the particular instance (Johnny D, who embarked Titanic in Southampton) may be close to the mean, as compared to all other possible values of the variable. It is also worth mentioning that, for models that include interactions, the part of the prediction attributed to a variable depends on the order, in which one sets the values of the explanatory variables. Note that the interactions do not have to be explicitly specified in the model structure as it is the case of, for instance, linear-regression models. They may also emerge as a result of fitting to the data a flexible model like, for instance, a regression tree. To illustrate the point, Figure 7.2 presents an example for a random-forest model with only three variables fitted to the Titanic data. Subsequently, we focus on the model’s prediction for a 2-year old boy that travelled in the second class. The predicted probability of survival is equal to 0.964, more than a double of the mean model-prediction of 0.407. We would like to understand which explanatory variables drive this prediction. Two possible explanations are illustrated in Figure 7.2. Explanation 1: We first consider the explanatory variables gender, class, and age, in that order. Figure 7.2 indicates negative contributions for the first two variables, and a positive contribution for the third one. Thus, the fact that the passenger was a boy decreases the chances of survival, as compared to the mean model-prediction. He traveled in the second class, which further lowers the probability of survival. However, as the boy was very young, this substantially increases the odds of surviving. This last conclusion is the result of the fact that most passengers in the second class were adults; therefore, a kid from the second class had higher chances of survival. Explanation 2: We now consider the order of explanatory variables: gender, age, and class. Figure 7.2 indicates a positive contribution of class, unlike in the first explanation. Again, the fact that the passenger was a boy decreases the chances of survival, as compared to the mean model-prediction. However, he was very young, and this increases the probability of survival as compared to adult men. Finally, the fact that the boy traveled in the second class increases the chance even further. This last conclusion stems from the fact that most kids travelled in the third class; thus, being a child in the second class would increase chances of survival. Figure 7.2: An illustration of the order-dependence of variable attributions. Two break-down plots for the same observation for a random-forest model for the Titanic data set. The contribution attributed to class is negative in the plot at the top and positive in the one at the bottom. The difference is due to the difference in the ordering of explanatory variables used to construct the plots (as seen in the labelling of the rows). 7.3 Method In this section, we introduce more formally the method of variable atribution. We first focus on linear models, because their simple and additive structure allows building intuition. Then we consider a more general case. 7.3.1 Break-down for linear models Assume the classical linear-regression model for dependent variable \\(Y\\) with \\(p\\) explanatory variables, the values of which are collected in vector \\(\\underline{x}\\), and a vector of \\(p\\) corresponding coefficients \\(\\underline{\\beta}\\). Note that we separately consider \\(\\beta^0\\), which is the intercept. Prediction for \\(Y\\) is given by the expected value of \\(Y\\) conditional on \\(\\underline{x}\\). In particular, the expected value is given by the following linear combination: \\[\\begin{equation} E_Y(Y | \\underline{x}) = f(\\underline{x}) = \\beta^0 + \\underline{x}&#39;\\underline{\\beta}. \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] Assume that we select a vector of values of explanatory variables \\(\\underline{x}_* \\in \\mathcal R^p\\). We are interested in the contribution of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable to model’s prediction \\(f(\\underline{x}_*)\\) for a single observation described by \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). A possible approach to evaluate the contribution is to measure how much the expected value of \\(Y\\) changes after conditioning on \\({x}^j_*\\). Using the notation \\(\\underline{x}^{j|=X^j}_*\\) (see Section 2.3) to indicate that we treat the value of the \\(j\\)-th coordinate as a random variable \\(X^j\\), we can thus define \\[\\begin{equation} v(j, \\underline{x}_*) = E_Y(Y | \\underline{x}_*) - E_{X^j}\\left[E_Y\\left\\{Y | \\underline{x}^{j|=X^j}_*\\right\\}\\right]= f(x_*) - E_{X^j}\\left\\{f\\left(\\underline{x}^{j|=X^j}_*\\right)\\right\\}, \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(v(j, \\underline{x}_*)\\) is the variable-importance measure for the \\(j\\)-th eplanatory variable evaluated at \\(\\underline{x}_*\\) and the last expected value on the right-hand-side of (7.2) is taken over the distribution of the variable (treated as random). For the linear-regression model (7.1), and if the explanatory variables are independent, \\(v(j,\\underline{x}_*)\\) can be expressed as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} v(j, \\underline{x}_*) = \\beta^0 + \\underline{x}_*&#39; \\underline{\\beta} - E_{X^j}\\left\\{\\beta^0 + \\left(\\underline{x}^{j|=X^j}_*\\right)&#39; \\underline{\\beta}\\right\\} = {\\beta}^j\\left\\{{x}_*^j - E_{X^j}(X^j)\\right\\}. \\tag{7.3} \\end{equation}\\] Using (7.3), the linear-regression prediction (7.1) may be re-expressed in the following way: \\[ f(\\underline{x}_*) = \\left\\{\\beta^0 + {\\beta}^1E_{X^1}(X^1) + ... + {\\beta}^pE_{X^p}(X^p)\\right\\} + \\left[\\left\\{{x}^1_* - E_{X^1}(X^1)\\right\\} {\\beta}^1 + ... + \\left\\{{x}^p_* - E_{X^p}(X^p)\\right\\} {\\beta}^p\\right] \\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\equiv (mean \\ prediction) + \\sum_{j=1}^p v(j, \\underline{x}_*). \\tag{7.4} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, the contributions of the explanatory variables \\(v(j, \\underline{x}_*)\\) sum up to the difference between the model’s prediction for \\(\\underline{x}_*\\) and the mean prediction. In practice, given a dataset, the expected value \\(E_{X^j}(X^j)\\) can be estimated by the sample mean \\(\\bar x^j\\). This leads to \\[\\begin{equation} {v}(j, \\underline{x}_*) = {\\beta}^j ({x}_*^j - \\bar x^j). \\end{equation}\\] Obviously, the sample mean \\(\\bar x^j\\) is an estimator of the expected value \\(E_{X^j}(X^j)\\), calculated using a dataset. For the sake of simplicity we do not emphasize this difference in the notation. Also, we ignore the fact that, in practice, we never know the true model coefficients and use their estimates instead. We are also silent about the fact that in practice the variables are not independent. We needed this simplified example just to build our intuition. 7.3.2 Break-down for a general case Again, let \\(v(j, \\underline{x}_*)\\) denote the variable-importance measure of the \\(j\\)-th variable and instance \\(\\underline{x}_*\\), i.e., the contribution of the \\(j\\)-th variable to the model’s prediction at \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). We would like the sum of the \\(v(j, \\underline{x}_*)\\) for all explanatory variables to be equal to the instance prediction. This property is called local accuracy. Thus, we want that \\[\\begin{equation} f(\\underline{x}_*) = v_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p v(j, \\underline{x}_*), \\tag{7.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(v_0\\) denotes the mean model-prediction. Denote by \\(\\underline{X}\\) the vector of random values of explanatory variables. If we rewrite equation (7.5) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X})|X^1 = {x}^1_*, \\ldots, X^p = {x}^p_*\\} = E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X})\\} + \\sum_{j=1}^p v(j, \\underline{x}_*), \\end{equation}\\] then a natural proposal for \\(v(j, \\underline{x}_*)\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} v(j, \\underline{x}_*) = E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^1 = {x}^1_*, \\ldots, X^j = {x}^j_*\\} - E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^1 = {x}^1_*, \\ldots, X^{j-1} = {x}^{j-1}_*\\}. \\tag{7.6} \\end{equation}\\] In other words, the contribution of the \\(j\\)-th variable is the difference between the expected value of the model’s prediction conditional on setting the values of the first \\(j\\) variables equal to their values in \\(\\underline{x}_*\\) and the expected value conditional on setting the values of the first \\(j-1\\) variables equal to their values in \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). Note that the definition does imply the dependence of \\(v(j, \\underline{x}_*)\\) on the order of the explanatory variables that is reflected in their indices (superscripts). To consider more general cases, let \\(J\\) denote a subset of \\(K\\) (\\(K\\leq p\\)) indices from \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\), i.e., \\(J=\\{j_1,j_2,\\ldots,j_K\\}\\) where each \\(j_k \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\). Furthermore, let \\(L\\) denote another subset of \\(M\\) (\\(M\\leq p-K\\)) indices from \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\), distinct from \\(J\\). That is, \\(L=\\{l_1,l_2,\\ldots,l_M\\}\\) where each \\(l_m \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\) and \\(J \\cap L = \\emptyset\\). Let us define now \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\Delta^{L|J}(\\underline{x}_*) &amp;\\equiv&amp; E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^{l_1} = {x}_*^{l_1},\\ldots,X^{l_M} = {x}_*^{l_M},X^{j_1} = {x}_*^{j_1},\\ldots,X^{j_K} = {x}_*^{j_K}\\}\\\\ &amp;-&amp; E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^{j_1} = {x}_*^{j_1},\\ldots,X^{j_K} = {x}_*^{j_K}\\}. \\end{eqnarray}\\] In other words, \\(\\Delta^{L|J}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) is the change between the expected model-prediction, when setting the values of the explanatory variables with indices from the set \\(J \\cup L\\) equal to their values in \\(\\underline{x}_*\\), and the expected prediction conditional on setting the values of the explanatory variables with indices from the set \\(J\\) equal to their values in \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). In particular, for the \\(l\\)-th explanatory variable, let \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\Delta^{l|J}(\\underline{x}_*) \\equiv \\Delta^{\\{l\\}|J}(\\underline{x}_*) &amp;=&amp; E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^{j_1} = {x}_*^{j_1},\\ldots,X^{j_K} = {x}_*^{j_K}, X^{l} = {x}_*^{l}\\}\\\\ &amp;-&amp; E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^{j_1} = {x}_*^{j_1},\\ldots,X^{j_K} = {x}_*^{j_K}\\}. \\tag{7.7} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Thus, \\(\\Delta^{l|J}\\) is the change between the expected prediction, when setting the values of the explanatory variables with indices from the set \\(J \\cup \\{l\\}\\) equal to their values in \\(\\underline{x}_*\\), and the expected prediction conditional on setting the values of the explanatory variables with indices from the set \\(J\\) equal to their values in \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). Note that, if \\(J=\\emptyset\\), then \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta^{l|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*) = E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^{l} = {x}_*^{l}\\} - E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X})\\} = E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^{l} = {x}_*^{l}\\} - v_0. \\tag{7.8} \\end{equation}\\] It follows that \\[\\begin{equation} v(j, \\underline{x}_*) = \\Delta^{j|\\{1,\\ldots, j-1\\}}(\\underline{x}_*) = \\Delta^{\\{1,\\ldots, j\\}|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)-\\Delta^{\\{1,\\ldots, j-1\\}|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*). \\tag{7.9} \\end{equation}\\] As it was mentioned in Section 7.2, for models that include interactions, the value of the variable-importance measure \\(v(j, \\underline{x}_*)\\) depends on the order of conditioning on explanatory variables. A heuristic approach to address this issue consists of choosing an order in which the variables with the largest contributions are selected first. In particular, the following two-step procedure can be considered. In the first step, the ordering is chosen based on the decreasing values of \\(|\\Delta^{k|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)|\\). Note that the use of absolute values is needed, because the variable contributions can be positive or negative. In the second step, the variable-importance measure for the \\(j\\)-th variable is calculated as \\[ v(j, \\underline{x}_*) = \\Delta ^{j|J}(\\underline{x}_*), \\] where \\[ J = \\{k: |\\Delta^{k|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)| &lt; |\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)|\\}. \\] That is, \\(J\\) is the set of indices of explanatory variables with scores \\(|\\Delta^{k|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)|\\) smaller than the corresponding score for variable \\(j\\). The time complexity of each of the two steps of the procedure is \\(O(p)\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of explanatory variables. Note, that there are also other possible approaches to the problem of calculation of variable attributions. One consists of identifying the interactions that cause a difference in variable-importance measures for different orderings and focusing on those interactions. This approach is discussed in Chapter 8. The other one consists of calculating an average value of the variance-importance measure across all possible orderings. This approach is presented in Chapter 9. 7.4 Example: Titanic data Let us consider the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) and passenger Johnny D (see Section 5.2.5) as the instance of interest in the Titanic data. The mean of model’s predictions for all passengers is equal to \\(v_0=\\) 0.2353095. Table 7.1 presents the scores \\(|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)|\\) and the expected values \\(E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^j = {x}^j_*\\}\\). Note that, given (7.8) and the fact that \\(E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^j = {x}^j_*\\}&gt;v_0\\) for all variables, we have got \\(E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^j = {x}^j_*\\}=|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)|+v_0\\). Table 7.1: Expected values \\(E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^j = {x}^j_*\\}\\) and scores \\(|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)|\\) for the random-forest model titanic_rf and Johnny D for the Titanic data. The scores are sorted in the decreasing order. variable \\(j\\) \\(E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X}) | X^j = {x}^j_*\\}\\) \\(|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)|\\) age = 8 0.7407795 0.5051210 class = 1st 0.6561034 0.4204449 fare = 72 0.6141968 0.3785383 sibsp = 0 0.4786182 0.2429597 parch = 0 0.4679240 0.2322655 embarked = Southampton 0.4602620 0.2246035 gender = male 0.3459458 0.1102873 Based on the ordering defined by the scores \\(|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)|\\) from Table 7.1, we can compute the variable-importance measures based on the sequential contributions \\(\\Delta^{j|J}(\\underline{x}_*)\\). The computed values are presented in Table 7.2. Table 7.2: Variable-importance measures \\(\\Delta^{j|\\{1,\\ldots,j\\}}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) for the random-forest model titanic_rf and Johnny D for the Titanic data, computed by using the ordering of variables defined in Table 7.1. variable \\(j\\) \\(E_{\\underline{X}}\\left\\{ f(\\underline{X}) | \\underline{X}^{\\{1,\\ldots,j\\}} = \\underline{x}^{\\{1,\\ldots,j\\}}_*\\right\\}\\) \\(\\Delta^{j|\\{1,\\ldots,j\\}}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) intercept \\((v_0)\\) 0.2353095 0.2353095 age = 8 0.5051210 0.2698115 class = 1st 0.5906969 0.0855759 fare = 72 0.5443561 -0.0463407 gender = male 0.4611518 -0.0832043 embarked = Southampton 0.4584422 -0.0027096 sibsp = 0 0.4523398 -0.0061024 parch = 0 0.4220000 -0.0303398 prediction 0.4220000 0.4220000 Results from Table 7.2 are presented in Figure 7.3. The plot indicates that the largest positive contributions to the predicted probability of survival for Johnny D come from explanatory variables age and class. The contributions of the remaining variables are smaller (in absolute values) and negative. Figure 7.3: Break-down plot for the random-forest model titanic_rf and Johnny D for the Titanic data. 7.5 Pros and cons BD plots offer a model-agnostic approach that can be applied to any predictive model that returns a single number for a single observation (instance). The approach offers several advantages. The plots are, in general, easy to understand. They are compact; results for many explanatory variables can be presented in a limited space. The approach reduces to an intuitive interpretation for linear models. Numerical complexity of the BD algorithm is linear in the number of explanatory variables. An important issue is that BD plots may be misleading for models including interactions. This is because the plots show only the additive attributions. Thus, the choice of the ordering of the explanatory variables that is used in the calculation of the variable-importance measures is important. Also, for models with a large number of variables, BD plots may be complex and include many explanatory variables with small contributions to the instance prediction. To address the issue of dependence of the variable-importance measure on the ordering of the explanatory variables, the heuristic approach described in Section 7.3.2 can be applied. Alternative approaches are described in Chapters 8 and 9. 7.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we use the DALEX package, which is a wrapper for the iBreakDown R package (Gosiewska and Biecek 2019). The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on CRAN and GitHub. For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.2.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class (see Section 5.2.5). We first retrieve the titanic_rf model-object and the data frame for Henry via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.2.7. We also retrieve the version of the titanic data with imputed missing values. titanic_imputed &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/27e5c&quot;) titanic_rf &lt;- archivist:: aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/4e0fc&quot;) (henry &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/a6538&quot;)) ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked ## 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). We also load the randomForest package, as the model was fitted by using function randomForest() from this package (see Section 5.2.2) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) explain_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = titanic_rf, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;, verbose = FALSE) The Explainer is needed to allow uniform access to predictive models regardless of their internal structure. With this object we can proceed to the model analysis. 7.6.1 Basic use of the predict_parts() function The DALEX::predict_parts() function decomposes model predictions into parts that can be attributed to individual variables. It calculates the variable-attribution measures for a selected model and the instance of interest. The object obtained as a result of applying the function is a data frame containing the calculated measures. In the simplest call, the function requires three arguments: explainer - an explainer-object, created with function DALEX::explain(); new_observation - an observation to be explained; it should be a data frame with a structure that matches the structure of the dataset used for fitting of the model; type - the method for calculation of variable attribution; the possible methods are “break_down” (the default), “shap”, “oscillations”, and “break_down_interactions”. In the code below, the argument type = \"break_down\" is explicitly used. The code essentially provides the variable-importance values \\(\\Delta^{j|\\{1,\\ldots,j\\}}(\\underline{x}_*)\\). bd_rf &lt;- predict_parts(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry, type = &quot;break_down&quot;) bd_rf ## contribution ## Random Forest: intercept 0.235 ## Random Forest: class = 1st 0.185 ## Random Forest: gender = male -0.124 ## Random Forest: embarked = Cherbourg 0.105 ## Random Forest: age = 47 -0.092 ## Random Forest: fare = 25 -0.030 ## Random Forest: sibsp = 0 -0.032 ## Random Forest: parch = 0 -0.001 ## Random Forest: prediction 0.246 By applying the generic plot() function to the object resulting from the application of the predict_parts() function we obtain a BD plot, shown in Figure 7.4. plot(bd_rf) Figure 7.4: Break-down plot obtained by the generic plot() function for the random-forest model titanic_rf and Henry for the Titanic data. Figure 7.4 can be used to compare the explanatory-variable attributions obtained for Henry with those computed for Johnny D (see Figure 7.3). Both explanations refer to the same random-forest model. We can see that the predicted survival probability for Henry (0.246) is almost the same as the mean prediction (0.235), while the probability for Johnny D is higher (0.422). For Johnny D, this result can be mainly attributed to the positive contribution of age and class. For Henry, class still contributes positively to the chances of survival, but the effect of age is negative. For both passengers the effect of gender is negative. Thus, one could conclude that the difference in the predicted survival probabilities is mainly due to the difference in age of Henry and Johnny D. 7.6.2 Advanced use of the predict_parts() function Apart from the explainer, new_observation, and type arguments, function predict_parts() allows additional ones. The most commonly used are: order - a vector of characters (column names) or integers (column indexes) that specify order of explanatory variables to be used for computing the variable-importance measures; if not specified (default), then a one-step heuristic is used to determine the order; keep_distributions - a logical value (FALSE by default); if TRUE, then additional diagnostic information about conditional distributions of predictons is stored in the resulting object and can be plotted with the generic plot() function. In what follows, we illustrate the use of the arguments. First, we specify the ordering of the explanatory variables. Toward this end, we can use integer indexes or variable names. The latter option is prerferable in most cases because of transparency. Additionally, to reduce clutter in the plot, we set max_features = 3 argument in the plot() function. The resulting plot is presented in Figure 7.5. It is worth noting that the attributions for variables gender and fare do differ from those shown in Figure 7.4. This is the result of the change of the ordering of variables used in computation of the attributions. bd_rf_order &lt;- variable_attribution(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry, type = &quot;break_down&quot;, order = c(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;, &quot;parch&quot;, &quot;sibsp&quot;, &quot;embarked&quot;)) plot(bd_rf_order, max_features = 3) Figure 7.5: Break-down plot for top three variables for the random-forest model titanic_rf and Henry for the Titanic data. We can use the keep_distributions = TRUE argument to enrich the resulting object with additional information about conditional distributions of predicted values. Subsequently, we can apply the plot_distributions = TRUE argument in the plot() function to present the distributions as violin plots. bd_rf_distr &lt;- predict_parts(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry, type = &quot;break_down&quot;, order = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;class&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;embarked&quot;, &quot;sibsp&quot;, &quot;parch&quot;), keep_distributions = TRUE) plot(bd_rf_distr, plot_distributions = TRUE) Figure 7.6: Break-down plot with violin plots summarizing distributions of predicted values for a selected order of explanatory variables for the random-forest model titanic_rf and Henry for the Titanic data. The resulting plot is presented in Figure 7.6. Red dots indicate the mean model’s predictions. Thin grey lines between violin plots indicate changes in predictions for individual observations. They can be used to track how do the model’s predictions change after consecutive conditionings. A similar code was used to create the plot in panel A of Figure 7.1 for Johnny D. 7.7 Code snippets for Python In this section, we use the dalex library for Python. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on pip and GitHub. For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.3.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class (see Section 5.3.5). In the first step we create an Explainer, an object that will provide a uniform interface for the predictive model. We use the Explainer constructor for this purpose. import pandas as pd henry = pd.DataFrame({&#39;gender&#39;: [&#39;male&#39;], &#39;age&#39;: [47], &#39;class&#39;: [&#39;1st&#39;], &#39;embarked&#39;: [&#39;Southampton&#39;], &#39;fare&#39;: [25], &#39;sibsp&#39;: [0], &#39;parch&#39;: [0]}, index = [&#39;Henry&#39;]) import dalex as dx titanic_rf_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_rf, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic RF Pipeline&quot;) To calculate the attributions with the break down method one can use the predict_parts method. The first argument is the observation for which the attributions are to be calculated. The type argument specifies how the attribute is to be calculated. To plot a waterfall chart just use the plot method. It generates an interactive chart based on the plotly library. bd_henry = exp_rf.predict_parts(henry, type=&#39;break_down&#39;) bd_henry.plot() Advanced users can make use from the argument order. This way, they can force a specific order of variables in the break down method. If there are many variables in the model, the waterfall diagram may be hard to read. In this situation, the max_vars argument can be used to limit the number of variables presented in the graph. bd_henry = exp_rf.predict_parts(henry, type=&#39;break_down&#39;, order=np.array([0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6])) bd_henry.plot(max_vars=5) References "],

However, for some models, like models with interactions, the procedure introduced in Chapter 7 depends on the ordering of the explanatory variables that is used in computations. In this chapter, we present an algorithm that addresses the issue. In particular, the algorithm identifies interactions between pairs of variables and takes them into account when constructing break-down (BD) plots. In our presentation, we focus on pairwise interactions that involve pairs of explanatory variables, but the algorithm can be easily extended to interactions involving a larger number of variables. 8.1 Intuition Interaction (deviation from additivity) means that the effect of an explanatory variable depends on the value(s) of other variable(s). To illustrate such a situation, we use the Titanic dataset (see Section 5.1). For the sake of simplicity, we consider only two variables, age and class. Age is a continuous variable, but we will use a dichotomized version of it, with two levels: boys (0-16 years old) and adults (17+ years old). Also, for class, we will consider just “2nd class” and “other.” Table 8.1 shows percentages of survivors for boys and adult men travelling in the second class and other classes on Titanic. Overall, the proportion of survivors among males is 20.5%. However, among boys in the second class, the proportion is 91.7%. How do age and class contribute to this higher survival probability? Let us consider the following two explanations. Explanation 1: The overall probability of survival for males is 20.5%, but for the male passengers from the second class the probability is even lower, i.e., 13.5%. Thus, the effect of the travel class is negative, as it decreases the probability of survival by 7 percentage points. Now, if, for male passengers of the second class, we consider their age, we see that the survival probability for boys increases by 78.2 percentage points, from 13.5% (for a male in the second class) to 91.7%. Thus, by considering first the effect of class, and then the effect of age, we can conclude the effect of -7 percentage points for class and +78.2 percentage points for age (being a boy). Explanation 2: The overall probability of survival for males is 20.5%, but for boys the probability is higher, i.e., 40.7%. Thus, the effect of age (being a boy) is positive, as it increases the survival probability by 20.2 pecentage points. On the other hand, for boys, travelling in the second class increases the probability further, from 40.7% overall to 91.7%. Thus, by considering first the effect of age, and then the effect of class, we can conclude the effect of +20.2 percentage points for age (being a boy) and +51 percentage points for class. Table 8.1: Proportion of survivors for men on Titanic. Class Boys (0-16) Adults (&gt;16) Total 2nd 11/12 = 91.7% 13/166 = 7.8% 24/178 = 13.5% other 22/69 = 31.9% 306/1469 = 20.8% 328/1538 = 21.3% Total 33/81 = 40.7% 319/1635 = 19.5% 352/1716 = 20.5% Thus, by considering effects of class and age in different order, we get very different attributions (contributions attributed to the variables). This is because there is an interaction: the effect of class depends on age and vice versa. In particular, from Table 8.1 we could conclude that the overall effect of the second class is negative (-7 percentage points), as it decreases the probability of survival from 20.5% to 13.5%. On the other hand, the overall effect of being a boy is positive (+20.2 percentage points), as it increases the probability of survival from 20.5% to 40.7%. Based on those effects, we would expect a probability of 20.5%-7%+20.2%=33.7% for a boy in the second class. However, the observed proportion of survivors is much higher, 91.7%. The difference of 91.7%-33.7%=58% is the interaction effect. We can interpret it as an additional effect of the second class specific for boys, or as an additional effect of being a boy for the male passengers travelling in the second class. The example illustrates that interactions complicate the evaluation of the importance of explanatory variables with respect to a model’s predictions. In the next section, we present an algorithm that allows including interactions in the BD plots. 8.2 Method Identification of interactions in the model is performed in three steps (Gosiewska and Biecek 2019): For each explanatory variable, compute \\(\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) as in equation (7.8) in Section 7.3.2. The measure quantifies the additive contribution of each variable to the instance prediction. For each pair of explanatory variables, compute \\(\\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) as in equation (7.8) in Section 7.3.2 and then the ,,net effect’’ of the interaction \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}}_I(x_*) \\equiv \\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)-\\Delta^{i|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)-\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*). \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] Note that \\(\\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) quantifies the joint contribution of a pair of variables. Thus, \\(\\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}}_I(x_*)\\) measures the contribution related to the deviation from additivity, i.e., to the interaction between the \\(i\\)-th and \\(j\\)-th variable. Rank the so-obtained measures for individual explanatory variables and interactions to determine the final ordering for computing the variable-importance measures. Using the ordering, compute variable-importance measures \\(v(j, \\underline{x}_*)\\), as defined in equation (7.9) in Section 7.3.2. The time complexity of the first step is \\(O(p)\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of explanatory variables. For the second step, the complexity is \\(O(p^2)\\), while for the third step it is \\(O(p)\\). Thus, the time complexity of the entire procedure is \\(O(p^2)\\). 8.3 Example: Titanic data Let us consider the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) and passenger Johnny D (see Section 5.2.5) as the instance of interest in the Titanic data. Table 8.2 presents single-variable contributions \\(\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\), paired-variable contributions \\(\\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\), and interaction contributions \\(\\Delta_{I}^{\\{i,j\\}}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) for each explanatory variable and each pair of variables. All the measures are calculated for Johnny D, the instance of interest. Table 8.2: Paired-variable contributions \\(\\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\), interaction contributions \\(\\Delta_{I}^{\\{i,j\\}}(\\underline{x}_*)\\), and single-variable contributions \\(\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) for the random-forest model titanic_rf and Johnny D for the Titanic data. Variable \\(\\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) \\(\\Delta_{I}^{\\{i,j\\}}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) \\(\\Delta^{i|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) age 0.270 fare:class 0.098 -0.231 class 0.185 fare:age 0.249 -0.164 fare 0.143 gender -0.125 age:class 0.355 -0.100 age:gender 0.215 0.070 fare:gender embarked -0.011 embarked:age 0.269 0.010 parch:gender -0.136 -0.008 sibsp 0.008 sibsp:age 0.284 0.007 sibsp:class 0.187 -0.006 embarked:fare 0.138 0.006 sibsp:gender -0.123 -0.005 fare:parch 0.145 0.005 parch:sibsp 0.001 -0.004 parch -0.003 parch:age 0.264 -0.002 embarked:gender -0.134 0.002 embarked:parch -0.012 0.001 fare:sibsp 0.152 0.001 embarked:class 0.173 -0.001 gender:class 0.061 0.001 embarked:sibsp -0.002 0.001 parch:class 0.183 0.000 The table illustrates the calculation of the interaction contributions. For instance, the additive contribution of age is equal to 0.270, while for fare it is equal to 0.143. The joint contribution of these two variables is equal to 0.249. Hence, the contribution attributed to the interaction is equal to 0.249-0.270-0.143=-0.164. Note that the rows of Table 8.2 are sorted according to the absolute value of the net contribution of the single explanatory variable or the net contribution of the interaction between two variables. For a single variable, the net contribution is simply measured by \\(\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*)\\), while for an interaction it is given by \\(\\Delta_{I}^{\\{i,j\\}}(\\underline{x}_*)\\). In this way, if two variables are important and there is little interaction, then the net contribution of the interaction is smaller than the contribution of any of the two variables. Consequently, the interaction will be ranked lower. This is the case, for example, of variables age and gender in Table 8.2. On the other hand, if the interaction is important, then its net contribution will be larger than the contribution of any of the two variables. This is the case, for example, of variables fare and class in Table 8.2. Based on the ordering of the rows in Table 8.2, the following sequence of variables is identified as informative: age, because it has the largest (in absolute value) net contribution equal to 0.270; fare:class interaction, because its net contribution (-0.231) is the second largest (in absolute value); gender, because variables class and fare are already accounted for in the fare:class interaction and the net contribution of gender, equal to 0.125, is the largest (in absolute value) among the remaining variables and interactions; embarked harbor, based on a similar reasoning as for gender; then sibsp and parch as variables with the smallest net contributions (among single variables), which are larger than the contribution of their interaction. Table 8.3 presents the variable-importance measures computed by using the following ordering of explanatory variables and their pairwise interactions: age, fare:class, gender, embarked, sibsp, and parch. The table presents also the conditional expected values (see equations (7.5) and (7.9) in Section 7.3.2) \\[E_{\\underline{X}}\\left\\{f(\\underline{X}) | \\underline{X}^{\\{1,\\ldots,j\\}} = \\underline{x}^{\\{1,\\ldots,j\\}}_*\\right\\}=v_0+\\sum_{k=1}^j v(k,\\underline{x}_*)=v_0+\\Delta^{\\{1,\\ldots\\,j\\}|\\emptyset}(\\underline{x}_*).\\] Note that the expected value presented in the last row, 0.422, corresponds to the model’s prediction for the instance of interest, passenger Johnny D. Table 8.3: Variable-importance measures \\(v(j,\\underline{x}_*)\\) and the conditonal expected values \\(v_0+\\sum_{k=1}^j v(k,\\underline{x}_*)\\) computed by using the sequence of variables age, fare:class, gender, embarked, sibsp, and parch for the random-forest model titanic_rf and Johnny D for the Titanic data. Variable \\(j\\) \\(v(j,\\underline{x}_*)\\) \\(v_0+\\sum_{k=1}^j v(k,\\underline{x}_*)\\) intercept (\\(v_0\\)) 0.235 age = 8 1 0.269 0.505 fare:class = 72:1st 2 0.039 0.544 gender = male 3 -0.083 0.461 embarked = Southampton 4 -0.002 0.458 sibsp = 0 5 -0.006 0.452 parch = 0 6 -0.030 0.422 Figure 8.1 presents the interaction-break-down (iBD) plot corresponding to the results shown in Table 8.3. The interaction between fare and class variables is included in the plot as a single bar. As the effects of these two variables cannot be disentangled, the plot uses just that single bar to represent the contribution of both variables. Table 8.2 indicates that class alone would increase the mean prediction by 0.185, while fare would increase the mean prediction by 0.143. However, taken together, they increase the average prediction only by 0.098. A possible explanation of this negative interaction could be that, while the ticket fare of 72 is high on average, it is actually below the median when the first-class passengers are considered. Thus, if first-class passengers with “cheaper” tickets, as Johnny D, were, for instance, placed in cabins that made it more difficult to reach a lifeboat, this could lead to lower chances of survival as compared to other passengers from the same class (though the chances could be still higher as compared to passengers from other, lower travel classes). Figure 8.1: Break-down plot with interactions for the titanic_rf model and Johnny D for the Titanic data. 8.4 Pros and cons iBD plots share many advanatages and disadvanatages of BD plots for models without interactions (see Section 7.5). However, in case of models with interactions, iBD plots provide more correct explanations. Though the numerical complexity of the iBD procedure is quadratic, it may be time-consuming in case of models with a large number of explanatory variables. For a model wth \\(p\\) explanatory variables, we have got to calculate \\(p*(p+1)/2\\) net contributions for single variables and pairs of variables. For datasets with a small number of observations, the calculations of the net contributions will be subject to a larger variabiliy and, therefore, a larger randomness in the ranking of the contributions. It is also worth noting that the presented procedure of identification of interactions is not based on any formal statistical-significance test. Thus, the procedure may suffer from false-positive and, especially for small sample sizes, false-negative errors. 8.5 Code snippets for R In this section, we use the DALEX package, which is a wrapper for iBreakDown R package. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on CRAN and GitHub. For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.2.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class (see Section 5.2.5). First, we retrieve the titanic_rf model-object and the data for Henry via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.2.7. We also retrieve the version of the titanic data with imputed missing values. titanic_imputed &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/27e5c&quot;) titanic_rf &lt;- archivist:: aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/4e0fc&quot;) (henry &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/a6538&quot;)) ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked ## 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). Note that, beforehand, we have got to load the randomForest package, as the model was fitted by using function randomForest() from this package (see Section 5.2.2) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) explain_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = titanic_rf, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;, verbose = FALSE) The key function to construct iBD plots is the DALEX::predict_parts() function. The use of the function has already been explained in Section 7.6. In order to perform calcuations that allow obtaining iBD plots, the required argument is type = \"break_down_interactions\". bd_rf &lt;- predict_parts(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry, type = &quot;break_down_interactions&quot;) bd_rf ## contribution ## Random Forest: intercept 0.235 ## Random Forest: class = 1st 0.185 ## Random Forest: gender = male -0.124 ## Random Forest: embarked:fare = Cherbourg:25 0.107 ## Random Forest: age = 47 -0.125 ## Random Forest: sibsp = 0 -0.032 ## Random Forest: parch = 0 -0.001 ## Random Forest: prediction 0.246 We can compare the obtained variable-importance measures to those reported for Johnny D in Table 8.3. For Henry, the most important positive contribution comes from class, while for Johnny D it is age. Interestingly, for Henry, a positive contribution of the interaction between embarked harbor and fare is found. For Johnny D, a different interaction was identified: for fare and class. Finding an explanation for this difference is not straightforward. In any case, in those two instances, contribution of fare appears to be modified by effects of other variable(s), i.e., its effect is not purely additive. By applying the generic plot() function to the object created by the DALEX::predict_parts() function we obtain the iBD plot. plot(bd_rf) Figure 8.2: Break-down plot with interactions obtained by applying the generic plot() function for the titanic_rf model and Henry for the Titanic data. The resulting iBD plot for Henry is shown in Figure 8.2. It can be compared to the iBD plot for Johnny D that is presented in Figure 8.1. 8.6 Code snippets for Python In this section, we use the dalex library for Python. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on pip and GitHub. For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.3.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class (see Section 5.3.5). In the first step we create an Explainer, an object that will provide a uniform interface for the predictive model. We use the Explainer constructor for this purpose. import pandas as pd henry = pd.DataFrame({&#39;gender&#39;: [&#39;male&#39;], &#39;age&#39;: [47], &#39;class&#39;: [&#39;1st&#39;], &#39;embarked&#39;: [&#39;Southampton&#39;], &#39;fare&#39;: [25], &#39;sibsp&#39;: [0], &#39;parch&#39;: [0]}, index = [&#39;Henry&#39;]) import dalex as dx titanic_rf_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_rf, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic RF Pipeline&quot;) To calculate the attributions with the break down method with interactions one can use the predict_parts method with type='break_down_interactions' argument. The first argument is the observation for which the attributions are to be calculated. Interactions are often weak and their net effects are not greater than the contributions of individual variables. If we would like to increase our preference for interactions we can increase the value of the interaction_preference argument. The default value of \\(1\\) means no preferences. bd_henry = exp_rf.predict_parts(henry, type=&#39;break_down_interactions&#39;, interaction_preference = 5) bd_henry.plot() References "],

We also indicated that, in the presence of interactions, the computed value of the attribution depends on the order of explanatory covariates that is used in calculations. One solution to the problem, presented in Chapter 7, is to find an ordering in which the most important variables are placed at the beginning. Another solution, described in Chapter 8, is to identify interactions and explicitly present their contributions to the predictions. In this chapter, we introduce yet another approach to address the ordering issue. It is based on the idea of averaging the value of a variable’s attribution over all, or a large number of, possible orderings. The idea is closely linked to “Shapley values” developed originally for cooperative games (Shapley 1953). The approach was first introduced by Štrumbelj and Kononenko (2010) and Štrumbelj and Kononenko (2014). It was widely adopted after the publication of the paper by Lundberg and Lee (2017) and Python’s library for SHapley Additive exPlanations, SHAP (Lundberg 2019). The authors of SHAP introduced an efficient algorithm for tree-based models (Lundberg, Erion, and Lee 2018). They also showed that Shapley values could be presented as an unification of a collection of different commonly used techniques for model explanations (Lundberg and Lee 2017). 9.1 Intuition Figure 9.1 presents BD plots for ten random orderings (indicated by the order of the rows in each plot) of explanatory variables for the prediction for Johnny D (see Section 5.2.5) for the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) for the Titanic dataset. The plots show clear differences in the contributions of various variables for different orderings. The most remarkable differences can be observed for variables fare and class, with contributions changing the sign depending on the ordering. Figure 9.1: Break-down plots for ten random orderings of explanatory variables for the prediction for Johnny D for the random-forest model titanic_rf for the Titanic dataset. Each panel presents a single ordering, indicated by the order of the rows in the plot. To remove the influence of the ordering of the variables, we can compute the mean value of the attributions. Figure 9.2 presents the averages, calculated over the ten orderings presented in Figure 9.1. Red and green bars present, respectively, the negative and positive averages Violet box plots summarize the distribution of the attributions for each explanatory variable across the different orderings. The plot indicates that the most important variables, from the point of view of the prediction for Johnny D, are age, class and gender. Figure 9.2: Average attributions for ten random orderings. Red and green bars present the means. Box plots summarize the distribution of contributions for each explanatory variable across the orderings. 9.2 Method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are based on “Shapley values” developed by Shapley (1953) in the cooperative game theory. Note that the terminology may be confusing at the first glance. Shapley values are introduced for cooperative games. SHAP is an acronym for a method designed for predictive models. To avoid the confusion, we will use the term “Shapley values”. Shapley values are a solution to the following problem. A coalition of players cooperates and obtains a certain overall gain from the cooperation. Players are not identical, and different players may have different importance. Cooperation is beneficial, because it may bring more benefit than individual actions. The problem to solve is how to distribute the generated surplus among the players? Shapley values offer one possible fair answer to this question (Shapley 1953). Let’s translate this problem to the context of a model’s predictions. Explanatory variables are the players, while model \\(f()\\) plays the role of the coalition. The payoff from the coalition is the model’s prediction. The problem to solve is how to distribute the model’s prediction across particular variables? The idea of using Shapley values for evaluation of local variable-importance was introduced by Štrumbelj and Kononenko (2010). We will define the values here using the notation introduced in Section 7.3.2. Let us consider a permutation \\(J\\) of the set of indices \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\) corresponding to an ordering of \\(p\\) explanatory variables included in the model \\(f()\\). Denote by \\(\\pi(J,j)\\) the set of the indices of the variables that are positioned in \\(J\\) before the \\(j\\)-th variable. Note that, if the \\(j\\)-th variable is placed as the first, then \\(\\pi(J,j) = \\emptyset\\). Consider the model’s prediction \\(f(\\underline{x}_*)\\) for a particular instance of interest \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). The Shapley value is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\varphi(\\underline{x}_*,j) = \\frac{1}{p!} \\sum_{J} \\Delta^{j|\\pi(J,j)}(\\underline{x}_*), \\tag{9.1} \\end{equation}\\] where the sum is taken over all \\(p!\\) possible permutations (orderings of explanatory variables) and the variable-importance measure \\(\\Delta^{j|J}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) was defined in equation (7.7) in Section 7.3.2. Essentially, \\(\\varphi(\\underline{x}_*,j)\\) is the average of the variable-importance measures across all possible orderings of explanatory variables. It is worth noting that the value of \\(\\Delta^{j|\\pi(J,j)}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) is constant for all permutations \\(J\\) that share the same subset \\(\\pi(J,j)\\). It follows that equation (9.1) can be expressed in an alternative form: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\varphi(\\underline{x}_*,j) &amp;=&amp; \\frac 1{p!}\\sum_{s=0}^{p-1} \\sum_{ \\substack{ S \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\setminus \\{j\\} \\\\ |S|=s }} \\left\\{s!(p-1-s)! \\Delta^{j|S}(\\underline{x}_*)\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac 1{p}\\sum_{s=0}^{p-1} \\sum_{ \\substack{ S \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\setminus \\{j\\} \\\\ |S|=s }} \\left\\{{{p-1}\\choose{s}}^{-1} \\Delta^{j|S}(\\underline{x}_*)\\right\\}, \\tag{9.2} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(|S|\\) denotes the cardinal number (size) of set \\(S\\) and the second sum is taken over all subsets \\(S\\) of explanatory variables, excluding the \\(j\\)-th one, of size \\(s\\). Note that the number of all subsets of sizes from 0 to \\(p-1\\) is \\(2^{p}-1\\), i.e., it is much smaller than number of all permutations \\(p!\\). Nevertheless, for a large \\(p\\), it may be feasible to compute Shapley values neither using (9.1) nor (9.2). In that case, an estimate based on a sample of permutations may be considered. A Monte Carlo estimator was introduced by Štrumbelj and Kononenko (2014). An efficient implementation of computations of Shapley values for tree based models was used in package SHAP (Lundberg and Lee 2017). From the properties of Shapley values for cooperative games it follows that, in the context of predictive models, they enjoy the following properties: Symmetry: if two explanatory variables \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) are interchangeable, i.e., for any set of explanatory variables \\(S \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,p\\}\\setminus \\{j,k\\}\\) we have got \\[ \\Delta^{j|S}(\\underline{x}_*) = \\Delta^{k|S}(\\underline{x}_*), \\] then their Shapley values are equal: \\[ \\varphi(\\underline{x}_*,j) = \\varphi(\\underline{x}_*,k). \\] Dummy feature: if an explanatory variable \\(j\\) does not contribute to any prediction for any set of explanatory variables \\(S \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,p\\}\\setminus \\{j\\}\\), that is, if \\[ \\Delta^{j|S}(\\underline{x}_*) = 0, \\] then its Shapley value is equal to 0: \\[ \\varphi(\\underline{x}_*,j) = 0. \\] Additivity: if model \\(f()\\) is a sum of two other models \\(g()\\) and \\(h()\\), then the Shapley value calculated for model \\(f()\\) is a sum of Shapley values for models \\(g()\\) and \\(h()\\). Local accuracy (see Section 7.3.2): the sum of Shapley values is equal to the model’s prediction, that is, \\[ f(\\underline{x}_*) - E_{\\underline{X}}\\{f(\\underline{X})\\} = \\sum_{j=1}^p \\varphi(\\underline{x}_*,j), \\] where \\(\\underline{X}\\) is the vector of explanatory variables (corresponding to \\(\\underline{x}_*\\)) that are treated as random values. 9.3 Example: Titanic data Let us consider the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) and passenger Johny D (see Section 5.2.5) as the instance of interest in the Titanic data. Box plots in Figure 9.3 present the distribution of the contributions \\(\\Delta^{j|\\pi(J,j)}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) for each explanatory variable of the model for 25 random orderings of the explanatory variables. Red and green bars represent, respectively, the negative and positive Shapley values across the orderings. It is clear that the young age of Johny D results in a positive contribution for all orderings; the resulting Shapley value is equal to 0.2525. On the other hand, the effect of gender is in all cases negative, with the Shapley value equal to -0.0908. The picture for variables fare and class is more complex, as their contributions can even change the sign, depending on the ordering. Note that Figure 9.3 presents Shapley values separately for each of the two variables. However, it is worth recalling that the iBD plot in Figure 8.1 indicated an important contribution of an interaction between the two variables. Hence, their contributions should not be separated. Thus, the Shapley values for fare and class, presented in Figure 9.3, should be interpreted with caution. Figure 9.3: Explanatory-variable attributions for the prediction for Johnny D for the random-forest model titanic_rf and the Titanic data based on 25 random orderings. Left-hand-side plot: box plots summarize the distribution of the attributions for each explanatory variable across the orderings. Red and green bars present Shapley values. Right-hand-side plot: Shapley values (mean attributions) without box plots. In most applications, the detailed information about the distribution of variable contributions across the considered orderings of explanatory variables may not be of interest. Thus, one could simplify the plot by presenting only the Shapley values, as illustrated in the right-hand-side panel of Figure 9.3. Table 9.1 presents the Shapley values underlying this plot. Table 9.1: Shapley values for the prediction for Johnny D for the random-forest model titanic_rf and the Titanic data based on 25 random orderings.

Lundberg and Lee (2017) showed that the method unifies different approaches to additive variable attributions, like DeepLIFT (Shrikumar, Greenside, and Kundaje 2017), Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (Binder et al. 2016), or Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016). The method has got a strong formal foundation derived from the cooperative games theory. It also enjoys an efficient implementation in Python, with ports or re-implementations in R. An important drawback of Shapley values is that they provide additive contributions (attributions) of explanatory variables. If the model is not additive, then the Shapley values may be misleading. This issue can be seen as arising from the fact that, in the cooperative games, the goal is to distribute the payoff among payers. However, in the predictive modeling context, we want to understand how do the players affect the payoff? Thus, we are not limited to independent payoff-splits for players. It is worth noting that, for an additive model, the approaches presented in Chapters 7–8 and in the current one lead to the same attributions. The reason is that, for additive models, different orderings lead to the same contributions. Since Shapley values can bee seen as the mean across all orderings, it is essentially an average of identical values, i.e., it also assumes the same value. An important practical limitation of the general model-agnostic method is that, for large models, the calculation of Shapley values is time consuming. However, sub-sampling can be used to address the issue. For tree based models, effective implementations are available. 9.5 Code snippets for R In this section, we use the DALEX package, which is a wrapper for the iBreakDown R package. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on CRAN and GitHub. Note that there are also other R packages that offer similar functionalities, like iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018), fastshap (Greenwell 2020) or shapper (Maksymiuk, Gosiewska, and Biecek 2019), which is a wrapper for the Python library SHAP (Lundberg 2019). For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.2.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old passenger that travelled in the first class (see Section 5.2.5). We first retrieve the titanic_rf model-object and the data frame for Henry via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.2.7. We also retrieve the version of the titanic data with imputed missing values. titanic_imputed &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/27e5c&quot;) titanic_rf &lt;- archivist:: aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/4e0fc&quot;) (henry &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/a6538&quot;)) ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked ## 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). We also load the randomForest package, as the model was fitted by using function randomForest() from this package (see Section 5.2.2) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. The model’s prediction for Henry is obtained with the help of the function. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) explain_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = titanic_rf, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;, verbose = FALSE) predict(explain_rf, henry) ## [1] 0.246 To compute Shapley values for Henry, we apply function predict_parts() as in Section 7.6 to the explainer-object explain_rf and the data frame for the instance of interest, i.e., Henry. By specifying the type=\"shap\" argument we indicate that we want to compute Shapley values. Additionally, the B=25 argument indicates that we want to select 25 random orderings of explanatory variables for which the Shapley values are to be computed. Note that B=25 is also the default value of the argument. shap_henry &lt;- predict_parts(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry, type = &quot;shap&quot;, B = 25) The resulting object shap_henry is a data frame with variable-specific attributions computed for every ordering. Printing out the object provides various summary statistics of the attributions including, of course, the mean. shap_henry ## min q1 median ## Random Forest: age = 47 -0.14872225 -0.081197100 -0.040909832 ## Random Forest: class = 1st 0.12112732 0.123195061 0.159974789 ## Random Forest: embarked = Cherbourg 0.01245129 0.022680335 0.045746262 ## Random Forest: fare = 25 -0.03180517 -0.011710693 -0.008647485 ## Random Forest: gender = male -0.15670412 -0.145184866 -0.126003135 ## Random Forest: parch = 0 -0.02795650 -0.007438151 -0.003043951 ## Random Forest: sibsp = 0 -0.03593203 -0.012978704 -0.005466244 ## mean q3 max ## Random Forest: age = 47 -0.060137381 -0.0230765745 -0.004967830 ## Random Forest: class = 1st 0.159090494 0.1851354780 0.232307204 ## Random Forest: embarked = Cherbourg 0.051056420 0.0558871772 0.117857725 ## Random Forest: fare = 25 0.002175261 0.0162267784 0.070487540 ## Random Forest: gender = male -0.126984069 -0.1115160852 -0.101295877 ## Random Forest: parch = 0 -0.005439239 -0.0008337109 0.003412778 ## Random Forest: sibsp = 0 -0.009070956 0.0031207522 0.007650204 By applying the generic function plot() to the shap_henry object we obtain the plot shown in Figure 9.4. It includes the Shapley values and box plots summarizing the distributions of the variable contributions for the selected random orderings. plot(shap_henry) Figure 9.4: A plot of Shapley values with box plots obtained by applying the generic plot() function to the explainer for the titanic_rf model and passenger Henry for the Titanic data. To obtain a plot with only Shapley values, i.e., without the box plots, we apply the show_boxplots=FALSE argument in the plot() function call. plot(shap_henry, show_boxplots = FALSE) Figure 9.5: A plot of Shapley values without box plots obtained by applying the generic plot() function to the explainer for the titanic_rf model and passenger Henry for the Titanic data. The resulting plot, shown in Figure 9.5, can be compared to the plot in the right-hand-side panel of Figure 9.3 for Johnny D. The most remarkable difference is related to the contribution of age. The young age of Johnny D markedly increases the chances of survival, in contrary to the negative contribution of the age of 47 for Henry. 9.6 Code snippets for Python In this section, we use the dalex library for Python. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on pip and GitHub. Note that the most popular implementation in Python is available in the shap library (Lundberg and Lee 2017), but here we show implementations from the dalex library because it is consistent with other methods shown in this book. For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.3.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class (see Section 5.3.5). In the first step we create an Explainer, an object that will provide a uniform interface for the predictive model. We use the Explainer constructor for this purpose. import pandas as pd henry = pd.DataFrame({&#39;gender&#39;: [&#39;male&#39;], &#39;age&#39;: [47], &#39;class&#39;: [&#39;1st&#39;], &#39;embarked&#39;: [&#39;Southampton&#39;], &#39;fare&#39;: [25], &#39;sibsp&#39;: [0], &#39;parch&#39;: [0]}, index = [&#39;Henry&#39;]) import dalex as dx titanic_rf_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_rf, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic RF Pipeline&quot;) To calculate the attributions with the break down method with interactions one can use the predict_parts method with type='shap' argument. The first argument is the observation for which the attributions are to be calculated. bd_henry = exp_rf.predict_parts(henry, type=&#39;shap&#39;) bd_henry.plot() References "],

None of those approaches is well-suited for models with a very large number of explanatory variables because they usually determine non-zero attributions for each variable in the model. However, in domains like, for instance, genomics or image recognition, models with hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of explanatory (input) variables are not uncommon. In such cases, sparse explainations with a small number of variables offer a useful alternative. The most popular example of such sparse explainers is the method Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and its modifications. The LIME method was originally proposed by Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin (2016). The key idea behind this method is to locally approximate a black-box model by a simpler glass-box model, which is easier to interpret. In this chapter, we describe this approach. 10.2 Intuition The intuition behind the LIME method is explained in Figure 10.1. We want to understand factors that influence a complex black-box model around a single instance of interest (black cross). The colored areas presented in Figure 10.1 correspond to decision regions for a binary classifier, i.e., they pertain to a prediction of a value of a binary dependent variable. The axes represent the values of two continuous explanatory variables. The colored areas indicate combinations of values of the two variables for which the model classifies the observation to one of the two classes. To understand the behavior of complex models locally around the point of interest, we will generate an artificial data set to which we will fit an glass-box model. Dots correspond to generated artificial data; the size of the dots corresponds to proximity to the instance of interest. We can fit a simpler glass-box model to the artificial data so that it will locally approximate the predictions of the black-box model. In Figure 10.1, a simple linear model (indicated by the dashed line) is used to construct the local approximation. The simpler model serves as a “local explainer” for the more complex model. We may select different classes of glass-box models. The most typical choices are regularized linear models like LASSO regression (Tibshirani 1994) or decision trees (Hothorn, Hornik, and Zeileis 2006). Both lead to sparse models that are easier to understand. The important point is to limit the complexity of the models, so that they are easier to explain. Figure 10.1: The idea behind the LIME approximation with a local glass-box model. The colored areas correspond to decision regions for a complex binary classification model. The black cross indicates to the instance (observation) of interest. Dots correspond to aritifical data around the instance of interest. The dashed line presents a simple linear model fitted to the artificial data. The simple model “explains” local behavior of the black-box model around the instance of interest. 10.3 Method We want to find a model that locally approximates a black-box model \\(f()\\) around the instance of interest \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). Consider class \\(G\\) of simple, interpretable models like, for instance, linear models or decision trees. To find the required approximation, we minimize a “loss function”: \\[ \\hat g = \\arg \\min_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} L\\{f, g, \\nu(\\underline{x}_*)\\} + \\Omega (g), \\] where model \\(g()\\) belongs to class \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), \\(\\nu(\\underline{x}_*)\\) defines a neighborhood of \\(\\underline{x}_*\\) in which approximation is sought, \\(L()\\) is a function measuring the discrepancy between models \\(f()\\) and \\(g()\\) in the neighborhood \\(\\nu(\\underline{x}_*)\\), and \\(\\Omega(g)\\) is a penalty for the complexity of model \\(g()\\). The penalty is used to favour simpler models from class \\(\\mathcal{G}\\). Very often in applications, this criterion is simplified by limiting class \\(G\\) to models with the same complexity, i.e. the same number of parameters. In such a situation, the part \\(\\Omega(g)\\) is the same for each model \\(g\\), so it can be omitted in optimization. Note that models \\(f()\\) and \\(g()\\) may operate on different data spaces. The black-box model (function) \\(f(\\underline{x}):\\mathcal X \\rightarrow \\mathcal R\\) is defined on the large, \\(p\\)-dimensional space \\(\\mathcal X\\) corresponding to the \\(p\\) explanatory variables used in the model. The glass-box model (function) \\(g(\\underline{x}):\\tilde{ \\mathcal X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal R\\) is defined on a \\(q\\)-dimensional space \\(\\tilde{ \\mathcal X}\\), so called space for interpretable representation, usually with \\(q &lt;&lt; p\\). We will present some examples of \\(\\tilde{ \\mathcal X}\\) in the next section. For now we will just assume that some function \\(h()\\) transforms \\(\\mathcal X\\) into \\(\\tilde{ \\mathcal X}\\). If we limit class \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) to linear models with a limited number, say \\(K\\), of non-zero coefficients, then the following algorithm may be used to find an interpretable glass-box model \\(g()\\) that includes \\(K\\) most important, interpretable, explanatory variables: Input: x* - observation to be explained Input: N - sample size for the glass-box model Input: K - complexity, the number of variables for the glass-box model Input: similarity - a distance function in the original data space 1. Let x&#39; = h(x*) be a version of x* in the lower-dimensional space 2. for i in 1...N { 3. z&#39;[i] &lt;- sample_around(x&#39;) 4. y&#39;[i] &lt;- f(z&#39;[i]) # prediction for new observation z&#39;[i] 5. w&#39;[i] &lt;- similarity(x&#39;, z&#39;[i]) 6. } 7. return K-LASSO(y&#39;, x&#39;, w&#39;) In Step 7, K-LASSO(y', x', w') stands for a weighted LASSO linear-regression that selects \\(K\\) variables based on the new data y' and x' with weights w'. Practical implementation of this idea involves three important steps, which are discussed in the subsequent subsections. 10.3.1 Interpretable data representation As it has been mentioned, the black-box model \\(f()\\) and the glass-box model \\(g()\\) operate on different data spaces. For example, let us consider a VGG16 neural network (Simonyan and Zisserman 2015) trained on ImageNet data (Deng et al. 2009). The model uses an image of the size of 244 \\(\\times\\) 244 pixels as input and predicts to which of 1000 potential categories does the image belong to. The original space \\(\\mathcal X\\) is of dimension 3 \\(\\times\\) 244 \\(\\times\\) 244 (three single-color channels (red, green, blue) for a single pixel \\(\\times\\) 244 \\(\\times\\) 244 pixels), i.e., the input space is 178,608-dimensional. Explaining predictions in such a high-dimensional space is difficult. Instead, from the perspective of a single instance of interest, the space can be transformed into superpixels, which are treated as binary features that can be turned on or off. Figure 10.2 (right-hand-side panel) presents an example of 100 superpixels created for an ambiguous picture. Thus, in this case the black-box model \\(f()\\) operates on space \\(\\mathcal X=R^{178608}\\), while the glass-box model \\(g()\\) applies to space \\(\\tilde{ \\mathcal X} = \\{0,1\\}^{100}\\). It is worth noting that superpixels, based on image segmentation, are frequent choices for image data. For text data, groups of words are frequently used as interpretable variables. For tabular data, continuous variables are often discretized to obtain interpretable categorical data. In case of categorical variables, combination of categories is often used. We will present examples in the next section. Figure 10.2: The left-hand-side panel shows an ambiguous picture, half-horse and half-duck. The right-hand-side panel shows 100 superpixels identified for this figure.

One could consider sampling the data points from the original dataset. However, there may not be enough points to sample from, because in high-dimensional datasets the data are usually very sparse and data points are “far” from each other. Thus, we need new, artificial data points. For this reason, the data for the development of the glass-box model are often created by using perturbations of the instance of interest. For binary variables in the low-dimensional space, the common choice is to switch (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) the value of a randomly-selected number of variables describing the instance of interest. For continuous variables, various proposals have been formulated in different papers. For example, Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio (2018) and Molnar (2019) suggest adding Gaussian noise to continuous variables. Pedersen and Benesty (2019) propose to discretize continuous variables by using quintiles and then perturbing the discretized versions of the variables. Staniak et al. (2019) discretize continuous variables based on segmentation of local ceteris-paribus profiles (for more information about the profiles, see Chapter 11). In the example of the duck-horse image in Figure 10.2, the perturbations of the image could be created by randomly excluding some of the superpixels. An illustration of this process is shown in Figure 10.3. Figure 10.3: The original image (left-hand-side panel) is transformed into a lower-dimensional data space by defining 100 super pixels (panel in the middle). The artificial data are created by using subsets of superpixels (right-hand-side panel). 10.3.3 Fitting the glass-box model Once the aritifical data around the instance of interest have been created, we may attempt to train an interpretable glass-box model \\(g()\\) from class \\(\\mathcal{G}\\). The most common choices for class \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) are generalized linear models. To get sparse models, i.e., models with a limited number of variables, LASSO (east absolute shrinkage and selection operator) (Tibshirani 1994) or similar regularization-modelling techniques are used. For instance, in the algorithm presented in Section 10.3, the K-LASSO method with K non zero coefficients has been mentioned. An alternative choice are CART (classification-and-regression trees) models (Breiman et al. 1984). For the example of the duck-horse image in Figure 10.2, the VGG16 network provides 1000 probabilities that the image belongs to one of the 1000 classes used for training the network. It appears that the two most likely classes for the image are ‘standard poodle’ (probability of 0.18) and ‘goose’ (probability of 0.15). Figure 10.4 presents LIME explanations for these two predictions. The explanations were obtained with the K-LASSO method which selected \\(K=15\\) superpixels that were the most influential from a model-prediction point of view. For each of the selected two classes, the \\(K\\) superpixels with non-zero coefficients are highlighted. It is interesting to observe that the superpixel which contains the beak is influential for the ‘goose’ prediction, while superpixels linked with the white colour are influential for the ‘standard poodle’ prediction. At least for the former, the influential feature of the plot does correspond to the intended content of the image. Thus, the results of the explanation increase confidence in the model’s predictions. Figure 10.4: LIME for two predictions (‘standard poodle’ and ‘goose’) obtained by the VGG16 network with ImageNet weights for the half-duck, half-horse image. 10.4 Example: Titanic data Most examples of the LIME method are related to the text or image data. In this section, we present an example of a binary classification for tabular data to facilitate comparisons between methods introduced in different chapters. Let us consider the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) and passenger Johnny D (see Section 5.2.5) as the instance of interest for the Titanic data. First, we have got to define an interpretable data space. One option would be to gather similar variables into larger constructs corresponding to some concepts. For example class and fare variables can be combined into “wealth,” age and gender into “demography,” and so on. In this example, however, we have got a relatively small number of variables, so we will use a simpler data representation in the form of a binary vector. Toward this aim, each variable is dichotomized into two levels. For example, age is transformed into a binary variable with categories “\\(\\leq\\) 15” and “&gt;15,” class is transformed into a binary variable with categores “1st/2nd/deck crew” and “other,” and so on. Once the lower-dimension data space is defined, the LIME algorithm is applied to this space. In particular, we first have got to appropriately transform data for Johnny D. Subsequently, we generate a new artifical dataset that will be used for K-LASSO approximations of the random-forest model. In particular, the K-LASSO method with \\(K=3\\) is used to identify the three most influential (binary) variables that will provide an explanation for the prediction for Johnny D. The three variables are: age, gender, and class. This result agress with the conclusions drawn in the previous chapters. Figure 10.5 shows the coefficients estimated for the K-LASSO model. Figure 10.5: LIME method for the prediction for Johnny D for the random-forest model titanic_rf and the Titanic data. Presented values are the coefficients of the K-LASSO model fitted locally to the predictions from the original model. 10.5 Pros and cons As mentioned by Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin (2016), the LIME method is model-agnostic, as it does not imply any assumptions about the black-box model structure; offers an interpretable representation, because the original data space is transformed (for instance, by replacing individual pixels by superpixels for image data) into a more interpretable, lower-dimension space; provides local fidelity, i.e., the explanations are locally well-fitted to the black-box model. The method has been widely adopted in the text and image analysis, partly due to the interpretable data representation. In that case, the explanations are delivered in the form of fragments of an image/text and users can easily find justification of such explanations. The underlying intuition for the method is easy to understand: a simpler model is used to approximate a more complex one. By using a simpler model, with a smaller number of interpretable explanatory variables, predictions are easier to explain. The LIME method can be applied to complex, high-dimensional models. There are several important limitations, however. For instance, as mentioned in Section 10.3.2, for tabular data there have been various proposals for finding interpretable representations for continuous and categorical explanatory variables. The issue has not been solved yet. This leads to different implementations of LIME, which use different variable-transformation methods and, consequently, that can lead to different results. Another important point is that, because the glass-box model is selected to approximate the black-box model, and not the data themselves, the method does not control the quality of the local fit of the glass-box model to the data. Thus, the latter model may be misleading. Finally, in high-dimensional data, data points are sparse. Defining a “local neighborhood” of the instance of interest may not be straightforward. Importance of the selection of the neighborhood is discussed, for example, by Alvarez-Melis and Jaakkola (2018). Sometimes even slight changes in the neighborhood strongly affect the obtained explanations. To summarize, the most useful applications of LIME are limited to high-dimensional data for which one can define a low-dimensional interpretable data representation, as in image analysis, text analysis, or genomics. 10.6 Code snippets for R LIME and its variants are implemented in various R and Python packages. For example, lime (Pedersen and Benesty 2019) started as a port of the LIME Python library (Lundberg 2019), while localModel (Staniak et al. 2019), and iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018) are separate packages that implement a version of this method entirely in R. Different implementations of LIME offer different algorithms for extraction of interpretable features, different methods for sampling, and different methods of weighting. For instance, regarding transformation of continuous variables into interpretable features, lime performs global discretization using quartiles, localModel performs local discretization using ceteris-paribus profiles (for more information about the profiles, see Chapter 11), while iml works directly on continuous variables. Due to these differences, the packages yield different results (explanations). In what follows, for illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.2.2. Recall that it is developed to predict the probability of survival from sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Johnny D, an 8-year-old passenger that travelled in the first class. We first retrieve the titanic_rf model-object and the data frame for Johnny D via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.2.7. We also retrieve the version of the titanic data with imputed missing values. titanic_imputed &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/27e5c&quot;) titanic_rf &lt;- archivist:: aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/4e0fc&quot;) (johnny_d &lt;- archivist:: aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/e3596&quot;)) ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked ## 1 1st male 8 0 0 72 Southampton Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). We also load the randomForest package, as the model was fitted by using function randomForest() from this package (see Section 5.2.2) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) titanic_rf_exp &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = titanic_rf, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;, verbose = FALSE) 10.6.1 The lime package The key functions in the lime package are lime(), which creates an explaination, and explain(), which evaluates explanations. However, the use of these functions is different from the functions discussed in the previous chapters. Therefore, we will use the predict_surrogate method of the localModel which is a simply to use interface to the lime library. The predict_surrogate function expects an DALEX explainer and the observation of interest. The argument type = \"lime\" ensures the implementation from the lime package will be used to determine the explanations. In this package one can specify two additional arguments: n_features=3 argument to indicate that the K-LASSO method should select no more than \\(K=3\\) most important variables, and n_permutations=1000 argument specifies that 1000 artifical data points are to be sampled for the local-model approximation. set.seed(1) library(&quot;lime&quot;) library(&quot;localModel&quot;) lime_johnny &lt;- predict_surrogate(titanic_rf_exp, johnny_d, n_features = 3, n_permutations = 1000, type = &quot;lime&quot;) The resulting object is a data frame with 11 variables. Note that it contains results based on a random set of artificial data points. Hence, in the output below, we present an exemplary set of results. as.data.frame(lime_johnny) ## model_type case model_r2 model_intercept model_prediction feature ## 1 regression 1 0.6826437 0.5541115 0.4784804 gender ## 2 regression 1 0.6826437 0.5541115 0.4784804 age ## 3 regression 1 0.6826437 0.5541115 0.4784804 class ## feature_value feature_weight feature_desc data prediction ## 1 2 -0.4038175 gender = male 1, 2, 8, 0, 0, 72, 4 0.422 ## 2 8 0.1636630 age &lt;= 22 1, 2, 8, 0, 0, 72, 4 0.422 ## 3 1 0.1645234 class = 1st 1, 2, 8, 0, 0, 72, 4 0.422 The output includes column case that provides indices of observations for which the explanations are calculated. In our case there is only one index equal to 1, because we asked for an explanation for only one observation, Johnny D. The feature column indicates which explanatory variables were given non-zero coefficients in the K-LASSO method. The feature_value column provides an information about the values of the original explanatory variables for the observations for which the explanations are calculated. On the other hand, the feature_desc column indicates how the original explanatory variable was transformed. Note that the applied implementation of the LIME method dichotomizes continuous variables by using quartiles. Hence, for instance, age for Johnny D was transformed into a binary variable age &lt;= 22. Column feature_weight provides the estimated coefficients for the variables selected by the K-LASSO method for the explanation. The model_intercept column provides of the value of the intercept. Thus, the linear combination of the transformed explanatory variables used in the glass-box model approximating the random-forest model around the instance of interest, Johnny D, is given by the following equation (see Section 2.5): \\[ \\hat p_{surrogate} = 0.5541115 - 0.4038175 \\cdot 1_{male} + 0.1636630 \\cdot 1_{age &lt;= 22} + 0.1645234 \\cdot 1_{class = 1st} = 0.4784804, \\] where \\(1_A\\) denotes the indicator variable for condition \\(A\\). Note that the computed value corresponds to the number given in the column model_prediction in the printed output. By applying the plot() function to the object containing the explanation, we obtain a graphical presentation of the results. The resulting plot (for the exemplary results) is shown in Figure 10.6. The length of the bar indicates the magnitude (absolute value), while the color indicates the sign (red for negative, blue for positive) of the estimated coefficient. plot(lime_johnny) Figure 10.6: Illustration of the LIME-method results for the prediction for Johnny D for the random-forest model titanic_rf and the Titanic data, generated by the lime package. 10.6.2 The localModel package The key tool of the localModel package is the individual_surrogate_model() function that fits the local glass-box model. The function is applied to the explainer-object obtained with the help of the DALEX::explain() function (see Section 5.2.6). Below we will use the predict_surrogate method which is a wrapper for individual_surrogate_model() with simplified interface. The main arguments of the predict_surrogate() function are: x, which specifies the explainer object; new_observation, which indicates the data frame with the data for the instance(s) of interest. The localModel implementation uses also two additional arguments, size i.e., the number of artificial data points to be sampled for the local model approximation and seed for setting a seed for random number ganeratiot for a repeateable execution. library(&quot;localModel&quot;) lime_johnny &lt;- predict_surrogate(titanic_rf_exp, new_observation = johnny_d, size = 1000, seed = 1, type = &quot;localModel&quot;) The resulting object is a data frame with seven variables (columns). For brevity, we only print out the first three variables. lime_johnny[,1:3] ## estimated variable original_variable ## 1 0.23530947 (Model mean) ## 2 0.30331646 (Intercept) ## 3 0.06004988 gender = male gender ## 4 -0.05222505 age &lt;= 15.36 age ## 5 0.20988506 class = 1st, 2nd, deck crew class ## 6 0.00000000 embarked = Belfast, Southampton embarked The printed output includes column estimated that provides the estimated coefficients of the LASSO regression model approximating the random-forest model results. Column variable provides the information about the corresponding variable. The implemented version of LIME dichotomizes continuous variables by using ceteris-paribus profiles (for more information about the profiles, see Chapter 11). The profile for variable age for Johnny D is presented in Figure 10.7. The profile indicates that the largest drop in the predicted probability of survival is observed when the value of age increases beyond about 15 years. Hence, in the output of the individual_surrogate_model() function, we see a binary variable age &lt; 15.36, as Johnny D was 8-year old. plot_interpretable_feature(lime_johnny, &quot;age&quot;) Figure 10.7: Discretization of the age variable for Johnny D based on the ceteris-paribus profile. The optimal change-point is around 15 years of age. By applying the generic plot() function to the object containing the explanation we obtain a graphical presentation of the results. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 10.8. The length of the bar indicates the magnitude (absolute value) of the estimated coefficient of the LASSO logistic-regression model. The bar are placed relative to the value of the mean prediction, 0.235. plot(lime_johnny) Figure 10.8: Illustration of the LIME-method results for the prediction for Johnny D for the random-forest model titanic_rf and the Titanic data, generated by the localModel package. 10.6.3 The iml package The key functions of the iml package are Predictor$new(), which creates an explainer, and LocalModel$new(), which develops the local glass-box model. The main arguments of the Predictor$new() function are model, which specifies the model-object, and data, the data frame used for fitting the model. But to keep examples consistent with previous sections we will use the predict_surrogate function which is a simply to use interface to the iml library. The predict_surrogate function expects an DALEX explainer and the observation of interest. The argument type = \"iml\" ensures the implementation from the lime package will be used to determine the explanations. In this package one can specify also argument k to specify the number of variables included in the local-approximation model. library(&quot;iml&quot;) library(&quot;localModel&quot;) lime_johnny &lt;- predict_surrogate(titanic_rf_exp, new_observation = johnny_d, k = 3, type = &quot;iml&quot;) The resulting object includes data frame results with seven variables that provides results of the LASSO logistic-regression model approximating the random-forest model. For brevity, we print out selected variables. lime_johnny$results[,c(1:5,7)] ## beta x.recoded effect x.original feature .class ## 1 -0.2026004727 1 -0.20260047 1st class=1st no ## 2 1.5958071680 1 1.59580717 male gender=male no ## 3 -0.0002231487 72 -0.01606671 72 fare no ## 4 0.2026004727 1 0.20260047 1st class=1st yes ## 5 -1.5958071680 1 -1.59580717 male gender=male yes ## 6 0.0002231487 72 0.01606671 72 fare yes The printed output includes column beta that provides the estimated coefficients of the local-approximation model. Note that two sets of six coefficients (12 in total) are given, corresponding to the prediction of the probability of death (column .class assuming value no, corresponding to the value of the survived dependent variable) and survival (.class asuming value yes). Column x.recoded contains the information about the value of the corresponding transformed (interpretable) variable. The value of the original explanatory variable is given in column x.original, with column feature providing the information about the corresponding variable. Note that the implemented version of LIME does not transform continuous variables. Categorical variables are dichotomized, with the resulting binary variable assuming the value of 1 for the category observed for the instance of interest and 0 for other categories. The effect column provides the product of the estimated coefficient (from column beta) and the value of the interpretable covariate (from column x.recoded) of the model approximating the random-forest model. By applying the generic plot() function to the object containing the explanation, we obtain a graphical presentation of the results. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 10.9. It shows values of the sets of six coefficients for both types of predictions (probability of death and survival). plot(lime_johnny) Figure 10.9: Illustration of the LIME-method results for the prediction for Johnny D for the random-forest model titanic_rf and the Titanic data, generated by the iml package. Note that age, gender and class are three correlated variables. Among the crew are only adults and mainly men. This is probably the reason why each of these three packages for LIME explanations generate a slightly different explanation for the model prediction for Johnny D. References "],

They result in a decomposition of a single prediction into components that could be attributed to particular variables. In this chapter, we focus on a method that analyses the effect of a selected variable in terms of changes of the model’s prediction induced by changes in the variable’s values. The method is based on the ceteris paribus principle. “Ceteris paribus” is a Latin phrase meaning “other things held constant” or “all else unchanged”. The method examines the influence of an explanatory variable by assuming that effects of all other variables are unchanged. The main goal is to understand how changes in the values of the variable affect the model’s predictions. Explanation tools (explainers) presented in this chapter are linked to the second law introduced in Section 1.3, i.e., the law of “Prediction’s speculation”. This is why the tools are also known as What-if model analysis or Individual Conditional Expectations (Goldstein et al. 2015). It appears that it is easier to understand how a black-box model is working if we can explore the model by investigating the influence of explanatory variables separately, changing one at a time. 11.2 Intuition Ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles show how the model’s prediction would change if the value of a single exploratory variable changed. In essence, a CP profile shows a conditional expectation of the dependent variable (response) for the particular explanatory variable. For example, panel A of Figure 11.1 presents response (prediction) surface for two explanatory variables, age and class, for the logistic-regression model titanic_lmr (see Section 5.2.1) for the Titanic dataset (see Section 5.1). We are interested in the change of the model’s prediction for passenger Henry (see Section 5.2.5) induced by each of the variables. Toward this end, we may want to explore the curvature of the response surface around a single point with age equal to 47 and class equal to “1st,” indicated in the plot. CP profiles are one-dimensional profiles that examine the curvature across each dimension, i.e., for each variable. Panel B of Figure 11.1 presents CP profiles for age and class. Note that, in the CP profile for age, the point of interest is indicated by the dot. The plots for both variables suggest that the predicted probability of survival vary considerably for different ages and classes. Figure 11.1: Panel A) shows model response (prediction) surface for two variables age and class. Ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles are conditional, one-dimensional profiles, that are marked with black curves. They help to understand the curvature of the surface while changing only a single explanatory variable. Panel B) CP profiles for individual variables, age (continuous) and class (categorical). Figure 11.2: Animated model response for 2D surface as in 11.1. 11.3 Method In this section, we introduce more formally one-dimensional CP profiles. Recall (see Section 2.3) that we use \\(\\underline{x}_i\\) to refer to the vector of values of explanatory variables corresponding to the \\(i\\)-th observation in a dataset. A vector with arbitrary values (not linked to any particular observation in the dataset) is denoted by \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). Let \\(x^{j}_{*}\\) denote the \\(j\\)-th element of \\(\\underline{x}_{*}\\), i.e., the value of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. We use \\(\\underline{x}^{-j}_{*}\\) to refer to a vector resulting from removing the \\(j\\)-th element from \\(\\underline{x}_{*}\\). By \\(\\underline{x}^{j|=z}_{*}\\), we denote a vector resulting from changing the value of the \\(j\\)-th element of \\(\\underline{x}_{*}\\) to (a scalar) \\(z\\). We define a one-dimensional CP profile \\(h()\\) for model \\(f()\\), the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable, and point of interest \\(\\underline{x}_*\\) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} h^{f,j}_{\\underline{x}_*}(z) = f\\left(\\underline{x}_*^{j|=z}\\right). \\tag{11.1} \\end{equation}\\] CP profile is a function that describes the dependence of the approximated expected value (prediction) of \\(Y\\) on the value \\(z\\) of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. Note that, in practice, \\(z\\) assumes values from the entire observed range for the variable, while values of all other explanatory variables are kept fixed at the values specified by \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). Note that in the situation when only a single model is considered, we will skip the model index and we will denote the CP profile for the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable and the point of interest \\(\\underline{x}_*\\) by \\(h^{j}_{\\underline{x}_*}(z)\\). 11.4 Example: Titanic data For continuous explanatory variables, a natural way to represent the CP function is to use a profile plot similar to one of those presented in Figure 11.3. In the figure, the dot on the curves marks the instance-prediction of interest, i.e., prediction \\(f(\\underline{x}_*)\\) for a single observation \\(\\underline{x}_*\\). The curve itself shows how the prediction would change if the value of a particular explanatory variable changed. Figure 11.3 presents CP profiles for the age variable in the logistic-regression model titanic_lmr and random-forest model titanic_rf for the Titanic dataset (see Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2, respectively). The instance of interest is passenger Henry, a 47-year-old man who travelled in the first class (see Section 5.2.5). It is worth observing that the profile for the logistic-regression model is smooth, while the one for the random-forest model is a step function with some variability. For Henry, the shape of the CP profiles is similar. If Henry were a newborn, with all other values kept unchanged, the prediction of both models would increase about 40 percentage points. And if Henry were 100 years old, the prediction of both models would decrease by more than 10 percentage points. Figure 11.3: Ceteris-paribus profiles for variable age for the logistic-regression (titanic_lmr) and random-forest (titanic_rf ) models that predict the probability of surviving based on the Titanic data. Dot indicates the value of the variable and of the prediction for passenger Henry. For a categorical explanatory variable, a natural way to represent the CP function is to use a barplot similar to one of those presented in Figure 11.4. In particular, the figure presents CP profiles for the class variable in the logistic-regression and random-forest models for the Titanic dataset (see Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2, respectively). For this instance (observation), passenger Henry, the predicted probability for the logistic-regression model would decrease substantially if the value of class changed to “2nd” or “3rd”. On the other hand, for the random-forest model, the largest change would be marked if class changed to “desk crew”. Figure 11.4: Ceteris-paribus profiles for variable class for the logistic-regression (titanic_lmr) and random-forest (titanic_rf ) models that predict the probability of surviving of passenger Henry based on the Titanic data. Usually, black-box models contain a large number of explanatory variables. However, CP profiles are legible even for tiny subplots, created with techniques like sparklines or small multiples (Tufte 1986). By using the techniques we can display a large number of profiles, while at the same time keeping profiles for consecutive variables in separate panels, as shown in Figure 11.5 for the random-forest model for the Titanic dataset. It helps if the panels are ordered so that the most important profiles are listed first. A method to assess the importance of CP profiles is discussed in the next chapter. Figure 11.5: Ceteris-paribus profiles for all continuous explanatory variables for the random-forest model titanic_rf for the Titanic dataset and passenger Henry. Dot indicates the values of the variables and of the prediction for Henry. 11.5 Pros and cons One-dimensional CP profiles, as presented in this chapter, offer a uniform, easy to communicate, and extendable approach to model exploration. Their graphical representation is easy to understand and explain. It is possible to show profiles for many variables or models in a single plot. CP profiles are easy to compare, as we can overlay profiles for two or more models to better understand differences between the models. We can also compare two or more instances to better understand model-prediction’s stability. CP profiles are also a useful tool for sensitivity analysis. However, there are several issues related to the use of the CP profiles. One of the most impotant ones is related to the presence of correlated explanatory variables. For such variables, the application of the ceteris paribus principle may lead to unrealistic settings and misleading results, as it is not possible to keep one variable fixed while varying the other one. For example, variables like surface and number of rooms, which can be used in prediction of an apartment’s price, are usually correlated. Thus, it is unrealistic to consider very small apartments with a large number of rooms. In fact, in a training dataset, there may be no such combinations. Yet, as implied by (11.1), to compute a CP profile for the number-of-rooms variable for a particular instance of a small-surface apartment, we should consider the model’s predictions \\(f\\left(\\underline{x}_*^{j|=z}\\right)\\) for all values of \\(z\\) (i.e., numbers of rooms) observed in the training dataset, including large ones. This means that, especially for flexible models like, for example, regression trees, predictions for a large number of rooms \\(z\\) may have to be obtained by extrapolating the results obtained for large-surface apartments. Needless to say, such extrapolation may be problematic. We will come back to this issue in Chapters 18 and 19. A somewhat similar issue is related to the presence of interactions in a model, as they imply the dependence of the effect of one variable on other one(s). Pairwise interactions require the use of two-dimensional CP profiles that are more complex than one-dimensional ones. Needless to say, interactions of higher orders pose even a greater challenge. A practical issue is that, in case of a model with hundreds or thousands of variables, the number of plots to inspect may be daunting. Finally, while barplots allow visualization of CP profiles for factors (categorical explanatory variables), their use becomes less trivial in case of factors with many nominal (unordered) categories (like, for example, a ZIP-code). 11.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present Ceteris paribus profiles as implemented in the DALEX package for R. Note that presented functions are, in fact, wrappers to package ingredients (Biecek et al. 2019) with simplified interface. There are also other R packages that offer similar functionalities, like condvis (O’Connell, Hurley, and Domijan 2017), pdp (Greenwell 2017), ICEbox (Goldstein et al. 2015), ALEPlot (Apley 2018), or iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018). For illustration, we use two classification models developed in Chapter 5.1, namely the logistic-regression model titanic_lmr (Section 5.2.1) and the random-forest model titanic_rf (Section 5.2.2). They are developed to predict the probability of survival after sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old male passenger that travelled in the first class (see Section 5.2.5). We first retrieve the titanic_lmr and titanic_rf model-objects and the data frame for Henry via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.2.7. We also retrieve the version of the titanic data with imputed missing values. titanic_imputed &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/27e5c&quot;) titanic_lmr &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/58b24&quot;) titanic_rf &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/4e0fc&quot;) (henry &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/a6538&quot;)) class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg Then we construct the explainers for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). We also load the rms and randomForest packages as the models were fitted by using functions from those packages and it is important to have the corresponding predict() functions available. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;rms&quot;) explain_lmr &lt;- explain(model = titanic_lmr, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Logistic Regression&quot;) explain_lmr$model_info$type = &quot;classification&quot; library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) explain_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = titanic_rf, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;) 11.6.1 Basic use of the predict_profile() function The easiest way to create and plot CP profiles is to use the predict_profile() function and then apply the generic plot() function to the resulting object. By default, profiles for all explanatory variables are calculated, while profiles for all numeric (continuous) variables are plotted. One can limit the number of variables for which calculations and/or plots are necessary by using the variables argument. To compute the CP profiles, the predict_profile() function requires arguments explainer, which specifies the name of the explainer-object, and new_observation, which specifies the name of the data frame for the instance for which prediction is of interest. As a result, the function returns an object of class ceteris_paribus_explainer. It is a data frame with the model’s predictions. Below we illustrate the use of the function for the random-forest model. cp_titanic_rf &lt;- predict_profile(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry) cp_titanic_rf ## Top profiles : ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked _yhat_ _vname_ _ids_ ## 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.246 class 1 ## 1.1 2nd male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.054 class 1 ## 1.2 3rd male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.100 class 1 ## 1.3 deck crew male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.454 class 1 ## 1.4 engineering crew male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.096 class 1 ## 1.5 restaurant staff male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.092 class 1 ## _label_ ## 1 Random Forest ## 1.1 Random Forest ## 1.2 Random Forest ## 1.3 Random Forest ## 1.4 Random Forest ## 1.5 Random Forest ## ## ## Top observations: ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked _yhat_ _label_ _ids_ ## 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.246 Random Forest 1 To obtain a graphical representation of CP profiles, the generic plot() function can be applied to the data frame returned by the predict_profile() function. It returns a ggplot2 object that can be processed further if needed. In the examples below, we use the ggplot2 functions, like ggtitle() or ylim(), to modify plot’s title or the range of the y-axis. Below we show the code that can be used to create plots similar to those presented in the upper part of Figure 11.5. By default, the plot() function provides a graph with plots for all numerical variables. To limit the display to variables age and fare, the names of the variables are provided in the variables argument. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 11.6. library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) plot(cp_titanic_rf, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris-paribus profile&quot;, &quot;&quot;) + ylim(0, 0.8) Figure 11.6: Ceteris-paribus profiles for variables age and fare and the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data. Dots indicate the values of the variables and of the prediction for Henry. To plot CP profiles for categorical variables, we have got to add the variable_type = \"categorical\" argument to the plot() function. In the code below, we use argument variables to indicate that we want to create plots for class and embarked variables. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 11.6. plot(cp_titanic_rf, variables = c(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;embarked&quot;), variable_type = &quot;categorical&quot;, categorical_type = &quot;bars&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris-paribus profile&quot;, &quot;&quot;) Figure 11.7: Ceteris-paribus profiles for variables class and embarked and the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data. Blue dots indicate the values of the variables and of the prediction for Henry. 11.6.2 Advanced use of the predict_profile() function The predict_profile() function is very flexible. To better understand how can it be used, we briefly review its arguments: explainer, data, predict_function, label - they provide information about the model. If the object provided in the explainer argument has been created with the DALEX::explain() function, then values of the other arguments are extracted from the object; this is how we use the function in this chapter. Otherwise, we have got to specify directly the model-object, the data frame used for fitting the model, the function that should be used to compute predictions, and the model label. new_observation - a data frame with data for instance(s), for which we want to calculate CP profiles, with the same variables as in the data used to fit the model. Note, however, that it is best not to inlcude the dependent variable in the data frame. y - the observed values of the dependent variable corresponding to new_observation. The use of this argument is illustrated in Section 13.1. variables - names of explanatory variables, for which CP profiles are to be calculated. By default variables = NULL and the profiles are constructed for all variables, which may be time consuming. variable_splits - a list of values for which CP profiles are to be calculated. By default variable_splits = NULL and the list includes all values for categorical variables and uniformly-placed values for continuous variables; for the latter, one can specify the number of the values with the grid_points argument (by default, grid_points = 101). The code below uses argument variable_splits to specify that CP profiles are to be calculated for age and fare, together with the list of values at which the profiles are to be evaluated. variable_splits = list(age = seq(0, 70, 0.1), fare = seq(0, 100, 0.1)) cp_titanic_rf &lt;- individual_profile(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry, variable_splits = variable_splits) Susbequently, to replicate the plots presented in the upper part of Figure 11.5, a call to function plot() can be used as below. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 11.6. plot(cp_titanic_rf, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;)) + ylim(0, 1) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris-paribus profile&quot;, &quot;&quot;) Figure 11.8: Ceteris-paribus profiles for variables class and embarked and the titanic_rf random-forest model. Blue dots indicate the values of the variables and of the prediction for Henry. In the example below, we present the code to create CP profiles for two passengers, Henry and Johnny D (see Section 5.2.5), for the random-forest model titanic_rf (Section 5.2.2). Toward this end, we first retrieve the johnny_d data frame via the archivist hook, as listed in Section 5.2.7. We then apply the individual_profile() function with the explainer-object explain_rf specified in the explainer argument and the combined data frame for Henry and Johnny D used in the new_observation argument. We apply argument variable_splits to specify that CP profiles are to be calculated for age and fare, together with the list of values at which the profiles are to be evaluated.

We use the scale_color_manual function to add names of passengers to the plot, and to control colors and positions. library(ingredients) plot(cp_titanic_rf2, color = &quot;_ids_&quot;, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;)) + scale_color_manual(name = &quot;Passenger:&quot;, breaks = 1:2, values = c(&quot;#4378bf&quot;, &quot;#8bdcbe&quot;), labels = c(&quot;henry&quot; , &quot;johny_d&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris-paribus profile&quot;, &quot;&quot;) Figure 11.9: Ceteris-paribus profiles for the titanic_rf model. Profiles for different passengers are color-coded. Dots indicate the values of the variables and of the predictions for the passengers. The resulting graph, which includes CP profiles for Henry and Johnny D, is presented in Figure 11.9. For Henry, the predicted probability of survival is smaller than for Johnny D, as seen from the location of the large dots on the profiles. The profiles for age indicate a somewhat larger effect of the variable for Henry, as the predicted probability, in general, decreases from about 0.6 to 0.1 with increasing values of the variable. For Johny D, the probability changes from about 0.45 to about 0.05, with a bit less monotonic pattern. For fare, the effect is smaller for both passengers, as the probability changes within a smaller range of about 0.2. For Henry, the changes are approximately limited to the interval [0.1, 0.3], while for Johnny D they are limited to the interval [0.4, 0.6]. 11.6.3 Comparison of models (challenger-champion analysis) One of the most interesting uses of the CP profiles is the comparison for two or more of models. To illustrate this possibility, first, we have go to construct profiles for the models. In our illustration, for the sake of clarity, we limit ourselves to the logistic-regression and random-forest models for the Titanic data. Moreover, we use Henry as the instance for which predictions are of interest. We use the predict_profile() function to compute the CP profiles for the two models. cp_titanic_rf &lt;- predict_profile(explain_rf, henry, variable_splits = variable_splits) cp_titanic_lmr &lt;- predict_profile(explain_lmr, henry, variable_splits = variable_splits) Subsequently, we construct the plot with the help of the plot() function. Note that, for the sake of brevity, we use the variables argument to limit the plot only to profiles for variables age and class. Every plot() function can take a collection of explainers as arguments. In such case profiles for different models are combined in a single plot. In the code presented below, argument color = \"_label_\" is used to specify that models are to be color-coded. The _label_ refers to the name of the column in the CP explainer that contains the model name. plot(cp_titanic_rf, cp_titanic_lmr, color = &quot;_label_&quot;, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris-paribus profiles for Henry&quot;, &quot;&quot;) Figure 11.10: Comparison of the titanic_lmr and titanic_rf models for Henry. Profiles for different models are color-coded. Dots indicate the values of the variables and of the prediction for Henry. The result is shown in Figure 11.10. For Henry, the predicted probability of survival is higher for the logistic-regression model than for the random-forest model. CP profiles for age show a similar shape, however, and indicate decreasing probability with age. For fare, the profile for the logistic-regression model suggests a slight increase of the probabilty, while for the random-forest a decreasing trend can be infered. The difference between the values of the CP profiles for fare increases with the increasing values of the variable. We can only speculate what is the reason for the difference. Perhaps the cause is the correlation between the ticket fare and class. The logistic regression model handles the dependency of variables differently than the random forest model. 11.7 Code snippets for Python In this section, we use the dalex library for Python. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on pip and GitHub. For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.3.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class (see Section 5.3.5). In the first step we create an Explainer, an object that will provide a uniform interface for the predictive model. We use the Explainer constructor for this purpose. import pandas as pd henry = pd.DataFrame({&#39;gender&#39;: [&#39;male&#39;], &#39;age&#39;: [47], &#39;class&#39;: [&#39;1st&#39;], &#39;embarked&#39;: [&#39;Southampton&#39;], &#39;fare&#39;: [25], &#39;sibsp&#39;: [0], &#39;parch&#39;: [0]}, index = [&#39;Henry&#39;]) import dalex as dx titanic_rf_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_rf, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic RF Pipeline&quot;) To calculate the CP profile one can use the predict_profile method. The first argument is the observation for which the attributions are to be calculated. The resulting object can be visualised with the plot method. One can specify the vector of variables. By default all continuous variables are plotted. cp_johnny = exp_rf.predict_profile(johnny_d) cp_johnny cp_johnny.plot(variables = [&#39;age&#39;, &#39;fare&#39;]) If you want to plot categorical variables it is advised to additionaly set variable_type = 'categorical'. cp_johnny.plot(variables = [&#39;class&#39;, &#39;embarked&#39;], variable_type = &#39;categorical&#39;) References "],

However, for a model with a large number of explanatory variables we may end up with a large number of plots that may be overwhelming. In such situation it might be useful to select the most interesting or important profiles. In this chapter, we describe a measure that can be used for such a purpose and that is directly linked to CP profiles. It can be seen as an instance-level variable-importance measure alternative to the measures discussed in the Chapters 7–10. 12.2 Intuition To assign importance to CP profiles, we can use the concept of profile oscillations. It is worth noting that the larger influence of an explanatory variable on prediction at a particular instance, the larger the fluctuations along the corresponding CP profile. For a variable that exercises little or no influence on a model’s prediction, the profile will be flat or will barely change. In other words, the values of the CP profile should be close to the value of the model’s prediction for the particular instance. Consequently, the sum of differences between the profile and the value of the prediction, taken across all possible values of the explanatory variable, should be close to zero. The sum can be graphically depicted by the area between the profile and the horizontal line representing the instance prediction. On the other hand, for an explanatory variable with a large influence on the prediction, the area should be large. Figure 12.1 illustrates the concept based on CP profiles introduced in previous Chapter in Figure 11.5. The larger the highlighted area in Figure 12.1, the more important is the variable for the particular prediction. Figure 12.1: The value of the colored area summarizes the ceteris-paribus (CP) profile oscillations and provides the mean of the absolute deviations between the CP profile and the instance prediction (here it is Henry). Plots are prepared for the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data. 12.3 Method Let us formalize this concept now. Denote by \\(g^j(z)\\) the probability density function of the distribution of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. The summary measure of the variable’s importance for the model’s prediction at \\(\\underline{x}_*\\), \\(vip_{CP}^{j}(\\underline{x}_*)\\), is defined by using the variable’s CP profile (11.1) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} vip_{CP}^j(\\underline{x}_*) = \\int_{\\mathcal R} |h^{j}_{\\underline{x}_*}(z) - f(\\underline{x}_*)| g^j(z)dz=E_{X^j}\\left\\{|h^{j}_{\\underline{x}_*}(X^j) - f(\\underline{x}_*)|\\right\\}. \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, \\(vip_{CP}^j(\\underline{x}_*)\\) is the expected absolute deviation of the CP profile from the model’s prediction at \\(\\underline{x}_*\\) over the distribution \\(g^j(z)\\) for the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. The true distribution of \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable is, in most cases, unknown. Thus, there are several options how to calculate (12.1). One is to calculate just the area under the CP curve, i.e., to assume that \\(g^j(z)\\) is a uniform distribution over the range of variable \\(X^j\\). It folows that a straightforward estimator of \\(vip_{CP}^{j}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(\\underline{x}_*) = \\frac 1k \\sum_{l=1}^k |h^{j}_{x_*}(z_l) - f(\\underline{x}_*)|, \\tag{12.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(z_l\\) (\\(l=1, \\ldots, k\\)) are the selected values of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. For instance, one can select use all unique values of \\(X^{j}\\) in the considered dataset. Alternatively, for a continuous variable, one can use an equidistant grid of values. Another approach is to use the empirical distribution of \\(X^{j}\\). This leads to the estimator defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,emp}(\\underline{x}_*) = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n |h^{j}_{\\underline{x}_*}(x^{j}_i) - f(\\underline{x}_*)|, \\tag{12.3} \\end{equation}\\] where index \\(i\\) runs through all observations in a dataset. The use of of \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,emp}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) is preferred when there are enough data to accurately estimate the empirical distribution and when the distribution is not uniform. On the other hand, \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) is in most cases quicker to compute and, therefore, it is preferred if we look for fast approximations. Note that, the local evaluation of the variables’ importance can be very different from the global evaluation. This is well illustrated by such a simple example. Consider a model \\[ f(x^1, x^2) = x^1 * x^2, \\] where varibles \\(x^1\\) and \\(x^2\\) take values in \\([0,1]\\). Consider prediction for an observation described by vector \\(\\underline{x}_* = (0,1)\\). In that case, the importance of \\(X^1\\) is larger than \\(X^2\\). This is because the CP profile \\(h^1_{x_*}(z) = z\\) while \\(h^2_{x_*}(z) = 0\\). Thus we observe oscillations for the first variable but no oscillations for the second. Globally, both variables are equally important because the model is symmetrical, but local behavior is different. 12.4 Example: Titanic data Figure 12.2 shows a barplot for the size of oscillations for explanatory variables for the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) for Henry, a 47-year-old man who travelled in the first class (see Section 5.2.5). In the left panel the measures were computed by using estimator \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(\\underline{x}_*)\\), given in (12.2), by using an equidistant grid of values. In the right panel the measures were computed by using estimator \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,emp}(\\underline{x}_*)\\), given in (12.3), by using an empirical distribution for explanatory variables. The longer the bar, the larger the CP-profile oscillations for a particular explanatory variable. Both approaches presented in Figure 12.2 agree that the most important variables for prediction for Henry are gender and age, followed by class. There is an interesting difference between these approaches regarding the sibsp variable. From the 5.3 graph we remember that this variable has a very skewed distribution. A significant mass of this variable is concentrated in zero, but few individuals have a high value of this variable. In such situations, the of empirical density will be very different from uniform distribution. Note that, while the variable-importance plot in Figure 12.2 does indicate which explanatory variables are important, it does not describe how the variables influence the prediction. In that respect, the CP profile for age for Henry (see Figure 11.5) suggested that, if Henry were older, this would significantly lower his probability of survival. One the other hand, the CP profile for sibsp (see Figure 11.5) indicated that, were Henry not travelling alone, this would increase his chances. Thus, the variable-importance plots should always be accompanied by plots of the relevant CP profiles. Figure 12.2: Variable-importance measures based on ceteris-paribus oscillations estimated by using (left panel) a uniform grid of explanatory-variable values, (right panel) empirical distribution of explanatory-variables for the titanic_rf model and passenger Henry for the Titanic data. 12.5 Pros and cons Oscillations of CP profiles are easy to interpret and understand. By using the average of oscillations, it is possible to select the most important variables for an instance prediction. This method can easily be extended to two or more variables. In such cases, one needs to integrate the equation (12.2) over a larger number of variables. There are several issues related to the use of the CP oscillations, though. For example, the oscillations may not be of help in situations when the use of CP profiles may itself be problematic (e.g., in the case of correlated explanatory variables or interactions – see Section 11.5). An important issue is that the CP-based variable-importance measures (12.1) do not fulfill the local accuracy condition (see Section 9.2), i.e., they do not sum up to the instance prediction for which they are calculated, unlike the break-down attributions (Chapter (7.2)) or Shapley values (Chapter (9.1)). 12.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present ceteris paribus oscillations as implemented in the DALEX package for R. For illustration, we use the random-forest model titanic_rf (Section 5.2.2). The model was developed to predict the probability of survival after sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old male passenger that travelled in the first class (see Section 5.2.5). We first retrieve the titanic_rf model-object and the data frame for Henry via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.2.7. We also retrieve the version of the titanic data with imputed missing values. titanic_imputed &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/27e5c&quot;) titanic_rf &lt;- archivist:: aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/4e0fc&quot;) (henry &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/a6538&quot;)) class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). We also load the randomForest package, as the model was fitted by using function randomForest() from this package (see Section 5.2.2) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. The model’s prediction for Henry is obtained with the help of that function. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) explain_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = titanic_rf, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;) predict(explain_rf, henry) [1] 0.246 12.6.1 Basic use of the predict_parts() function To calculate CP-profile oscillations, we will use again the predict_parts() function, but this time with type=\"oscillations_uni\" for the Equation \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(\\underline{x}_*)\\) or type=\"oscillations_emp\" for the Equation \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,emp}(\\underline{x}_*)\\). The function was already introduced in Section 7.6. In particular, we apply it to explainer explain_rf for the random-forest model titanic_rf and the data frame for the instance of interest, i.e., henry. Additionally, we specify the type=\"oscillations_uni\" argument to indicate that we want to compute CP-profile oscillations and the estimated value of the variable-importance measure as defined in Equation (12.2). Note that, one nesd to specify type=\"oscillations_emp\" to get oscillations estimated with empirical density as defined in Equation (12.2). By default, oscillations are calculated for all explanatory variables. Use the variable argument to specify subset of variables. oscillations_uniform &lt;- predict_parts(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry, type = &quot;oscillations_uni&quot;) oscillations_uniform ## _vname_ _ids_ oscillations ## 2 gender 1 0.33700000 ## 4 sibsp 1 0.16859406 ## 3 age 1 0.16744554 ## 1 class 1 0.14257143 ## 6 fare 1 0.09942574 ## 7 embarked 1 0.02400000 ## 5 parch 1 0.01031683 The resulting object is of class “ceteris_paribus_oscillations”, which is a data frame with three variables _vname_, _ids_, and oscillations that provide, respectively, the name of the variable, the value of the identifier of the instance, and the estimated value of the variable-importance measure. Addtionally, the object has also got an overloaded plot() function. We can use the latter function to plot the estimated values of the variable-importance measure for the instance of interest. In the code below, before creating the plot, we make the identifier for Henry more explicit. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 12.3. oscillations_uniform$`_ids_` &lt;- &quot;Henry&quot; plot(oscillations_uniform) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris-paribus Oscillations&quot;, &quot;Expectation over uniform distribution (unique values)&quot;) Figure 12.3: Variable-importance measures based on ceteris-paribus oscillations estimated by the oscillations_uni method of the predict_parts() function for the titanic_rf model and Henry for the Titanic data. 12.6.2 Advanced use of the predict_parts() function As mentioned in the previous section, the predict_parts() function with type = \"oscillations_uni\" calculates oscilations accoring to the Equation \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(\\underline{x}_*)\\), and with type = \"oscillations_emp\" accoring to the Equation \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,emp}(\\underline{x}_*)\\). However, other distributions solutions can also be used. For instance, for a continuous explanatory variable, one could apply the same estimator, but using an predefined grid of values. Toward this aim, we can use the variable_splits argument to explicitly specify values for the density estimation. Its application is illustrated in the code below. oscillations_equidist &lt;- predict_parts(explain_rf, henry, variable_splits = list(age = seq(0, 65, 0.1), fare = seq(0, 200, 0.1), gender = unique(titanic_imputed$gender), class = unique(titanic_imputed$class)), type = &quot;oscillations&quot;) oscillations_equidist ## _vname_ _ids_ oscillations ## 3 gender 1 0.3370000 ## 1 age 1 0.1677235 ## 4 class 1 0.1425714 ## 2 fare 1 0.1040790 We can use the plot() function to create a barplot of the estimated values. In the code below, before creating the plot, we make the identifier for Henry more explicit. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 12.2. oscillations_equidist$`_ids_` &lt;- &quot;Henry&quot; plot(oscillations_equidist) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris-paribus Oscillations&quot;, &quot;Expectation over specified grid of points&quot;) Figure 12.4: Variable-importance measures based on ceteris-paribus oscillations estimated by using a specified grid of points for the titanic_rf model and passenger Henry for the Titanic data.

In such a situation it is often said that “the model does not cover well some areas of the input space”. For example, a model fitted to the data for “typical” patients in a certain hospital may not perform well for patients from another hospital with possible different characteristics. Or, a model developed to evalute the risk of spring-holiday consumer-loans may not perform well in the case of autumn-loans for Christmas-holiday gifts. For this reason, in case of important decisions, it is worthwhile to check how the model behaves locally for observations similar to the instance of interest. In this chapter, we present two local-diagnostics techniques that address this issue. The first one are local- fidelity plots that evaluate the local predictive performance of the model around the observation of interest. The second one are local-stability plots that assess the (local) stability of predictions around the observation of interest. 13.2 Intuition Assume that for the observation of interest we have identified a set of observations from the training data witch similar characteristics. We will call these similar observations “neighbors”. The basic idea behind local-fidelity plots is to compare the distribution of residuals (i.e., differences between the observed and predicted value of the dependent variable; see equation (2.1)) for the neighbors with the distribution of residuals for the entire training dataset. Figure 13.1 presents histograms of residuals for the entire dataset and for a selected set of 25 neighbors for an instance of interest for the random-forest model for the apartment-prices dataset (Section 5.5.2). The distribution of residuals for the entire dataset is rather symmetric and centered around 0, suggesting a reasonable overall performance of the model. On the other hand, the residuals for the selected neighbors are centered around the value of 500. This suggests that, for the apartments similar to the one of interest, the model is biased towards values smaller than the observed ones (residuals are positive, so on average the observed value of the dependent variable is larger than the predicted value). Figure 13.1: Histograms of residuals for the apartments_rf model for the apartment-prices dataset. Upper panel: residuals calculated for all observations from the dataset. Bottom panel: residuals calculated for 25 nearest neighbors of the instance of interest. The idea behind local-stability plots is to check whether small changes in the explanatory variables, as represented by the changes within the set of neighbors, have got much influence on the predictions. Figure 13.2 presents CP profiles for variable age for an instance of interest and its 10 nearest neighbors for the random-forest model for the Titanic dataset (Section 5.2.2). The profiles are almost parallel and very close to each other. In fact, some of them overlap so that only 5 different ones are visible. This suggests that the model’s predictions are stable around the instance of interest. Of course, CP profiles for different explanatory variables may be very different, so a natural question is which variables should we examine? The obvious choice is to focus on the variables that are the most important according to a variable-importance measure such as the ones discussed in Chapters 7, 9, 10, or 12. Figure 13.2: Ceteris-paribus profiles for a selected instance (dark violet line) and 10 nearest neighbors (light grey lines) for the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data. The profiles are almost parallel and close to each other what suggests the stability of the model around the selected instance. In fact, some of them overlap so that only 5 different ones are visible. 13.3 Method To construct local-fidelity or local-stability plots, we have got to, first, select “neighbors” of the observation of interest. Then, for the fidelity analysis, we have got to calculate and compare residuals for the neighbors. For the stability analysis, we have got to calculate and visualize CP profiles for the neighbors. In what follows, we discuss each of these steps in more detail. 13.3.1 Nearest neighbors There are two important questions related to the selection of the neighbors “nearest” to the instance (observation) of interest: How many neighbors should we choose? What metric should be used to measure the “proximity” of observations? The answer to both questions is it depends. The smaller the number of neighbors, the more local is the analysis. However, selecting a very small number will lead to a larger variability of the results. In many cases we found that having about 20 neighbors works fine. However, one should always take into account computational time (because a smaller number of neighbors will result in faster calculations) and the size of the dataset (because, for a small dataset, a smaller set of neighbors may be preferred). The metric is very important. The more explanatory variables, the more important is the choice. In particular, the metric should be capable of accommodating variables of different nature (categorical, continuous). Our default choice is the Gower similarity measure: \\[\\begin{equation} d_{gower}(\\underline{x}_i, \\underline{x}_j) = \\frac{1}{p} \\sum_{k=1}^p d^k(x_i^k, x_j^k), \\tag{13.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\underline{x}_i\\) is a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector of values of explanatory variables for the \\(i\\)-th observation and \\(d^k(x_i^k,x_j^k)\\) is the distance between the values of the \\(k\\)-th variable for the \\(i\\)-th and \\(j\\)-th observations. Note that \\(p\\) may be equal to the number of all explanatory variables included in the model, or only a subset of them. Metric \\(d^k()\\) in (13.1) depends on the nature of the variable. For a continuous variable it is equal to \\[ d^k(x_i^k, x_j^k)=\\frac{|x_i^k-x_j^k|}{\\max(x_1^k,\\ldots,x_n^k)-\\min(x_1^k,\\ldots,x_n^k)}, \\] i.e., the absolute difference scaled by the observed range of the variable. On the other hand, for a categorical variable, \\[ d^k(x_i^k, x_j^k)=1_{x_i^k = x_j^k}, \\] where \\(1_A\\) is the indicator function for condition \\(A\\). An advantage of the Gower similarity measure is that it can be used for vectors with both categorical and continuous variables. A disadvantage is that it takes into account neither correlation between variables nor variable importance. For a high-dimensional setting, an interesting alternative is the proximity measure used in random forests (Leo Breiman 2001a), as it takes into account variable importance; however, it requires a fitted random-forest model. Once we have decided on the number of neighbors, we can use the chosen metric to select the required number of observations “closest” to the one of interest. 13.3.2 Local-fidelity plot Figure 13.1 summarizes two distributions of residuals, i.e. residuals for the neighbors of the observation of interest vs residuals for the entire training dataset except neighbors. For a typical observation, these two distributions shall be similar. An alarming situation is if the residuals for the neighbors are shifted towards positive or negative values. Apart from visual examination, we may use statistical tests to compare the two distributions. If we do not want to assume any particular parametric form of the distributions (like, e.g., normal), we may choose non-parametric tests like the Wilcoxon test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For statistical tests, it is important that the two sets are disjointed. 13.3.3 Local-stability plot Once neighbors of the observation of interest have been identified, we can graphically compare CP profiles for selected (or all) variables. For a model with a large number of variables, we may end up with a large number of plots. In such a case, a better strategy is to focus only on a few most important variables, selected by using a variable-importance measure (see, for example, Chapter 12). CP profiles are helpful to assess the model stability. In addition, we can enhance the plot by adding residuals to them to allow evaluation of the local model-fit. The plot that includes CP profiles for the nearest neighbors and the corresponding residuals is called a local-stability plot. 13.4 Example: Titanic As an example, we will consider the prediction for Johnny D (see Section 5.2.5) for the random-forest model for the Titanic data (see Section 5.2.2). Figure 13.3 presents a detailed explanation of the elements of a local-stability plot for age, a continuous explanatory variable. The plot includes eight nearest neighbors of Johnny D (see Section 5.2.5). The green line shows the CP profile for the instance of interest. Profiles of the nearest neighbors are marked with grey lines. The vertical intervals correspond to residuals; the shorter the interval, the smaller the residual and the more accurate prediction of the model. Blue intervals correspond to positive residuals, red intervals to negative residuals. For an additive model, CP profiles will be approximately parallel. For a model with stable predictions, the profiles should be close to each other. This is not the case of Figure 13.3, in which profiles are quite apart from each other. Thus, the plot suggests potential instability of the model’s predictions. Note that there are positive and negative residuals included in the plot. This indicates that, on average, the instance prediction itself should not be biased. Figure 13.3: Elements of a local-stability plot for a continuous explanatory variable. Ceteris-paribus profiles for variable age for Johnny D and 5 nearest neighbors for the random-forest model for the Titanic data. 13.5 Pros and cons Local-stability plots may be very helpful to check if the model is locally additive, as for such models the CP profiles should be parallel. Also, the plots can allow assessment whether the model is locally stable, as in that case the CP profiles should be close to each other. Local-fidelity plots are useful in checking whether the model fit for the instance of interest is unbiased, as in that case the residuals should be small and their distribution should be balanced around 0. The disadvantage of both types of plots is that they are quite complex and lack objective measures of the quality of the model fit. Thus, they are mainly suitable for an exploratory analysis. 13.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present local diagnostic plots as implemented in the DALEX package for R. For illustration, we use the random-forest model titanic_rf (Section 5.2.2). The model was developed to predict the probability of survival after sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for Henry, a 47-year-old male passenger that travelled in the first class (see Section 5.2.5). We first retrieve the titanic_rf model-object and the data frame for Henry via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.2.7. We also retrieve the version of the titanic data with imputed missing values. titanic_imputed &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/27e5c&quot;) titanic_rf &lt;- archivist:: aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/4e0fc&quot;) (henry &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/a6538&quot;)) ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked ## 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). We also load the randomForest package, as the model was fitted by using function randomForest() from this package (see Section 5.2.2) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. The model’s prediction for Henry is obtained with the help of that function. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) explain_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = titanic_rf, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;, verbose = FALSE) predict(explain_rf, henry) ## [1] 0.246 To construct a local-fidelity plot similar to the one shown Figure 13.1, we have got to select a number of “neighbors” for Henry. Toward this aim we can use the predict_diagnostics() function from the DALEX package. The main arguments of the function are explainer, which specifies the name of the explainer-object for the model to be explained, and new_observation, which specifies the name of the data frame for the instance for which prediction is of interest. Additional useful arguments are neighbors, which specifies the number of observations similar to the instance of interest to be selected (default is 50), and distance, the function used to measure the similarity of the observations (by default, the Gower similarity measure is used). Note that function predict_diagnostics() has to compute residuals. Thus, for the explainer we need to specify y and residual_function arguments (see Section 5.2.6). Note that, in the call to the explain function creating the explain_rf object, we used the default NULL value of the residual_function argument. This means that model residuals are calculated as in (2.1). id_rf &lt;- predict_diagnostics(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry, neighbors = 100) id_rf ## ## Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ## ## data: residuals_other and residuals_sel ## D = 0.40467, p-value = 5.274e-14 ## alternative hypothesis: two-sided The resulting object is of class “predict_diagnostics”. It is a list of several components that includes, among others, histograms summarizing the distribution of residuals for the entire training dataset and for the neighbors, as well as the result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing the two distributions. The test result is given by default when the object is printed out. In our case, it suggests a statistically significant difference between the two distributions. We can use the plot() function to compare the distributions graphically. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 13.4. The plot suggests that the distribution of the residuals for Henry’s neighbors might be slightly shifted towards positive values, as compared to the overall distribution. plot(id_rf) Figure 13.4: The local-fidelity plot for titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data and Henry with 100 neighbors. Function predict_diagnostics() can be also used to construct local-stability plots. Toward this aim, we have got to select the explanatory variable, for which we want to create the plot. We can do it by passing the name of the variable to the variables argument of the function. In the code below, we first calculate CP profiles and residuals for age and 10 neighbors of Henry. id_rf_age &lt;- predict_diagnostics(explainer = explain_rf, new_observation = henry, neighbors = 10, variables = &quot;age&quot;) By applying the plot() function to the resulting object, we obtain the local-stability plot shown in Figure 13.5. The profiles are relatively close to each other, suggesting stability of predictions. There are more negative than positive residuals, which may be seen as a signal of a (local) positive bias of the predictions. plot(id_rf_age) Figure 13.5: The local-stability plot for variable age in the titanic_rf random-forest model for the Titanic data and Henry with 10 neighbors.

Each chapter was devoted to a single technique. In practice, these techniques are rarely used separately. Rather, it is more informative to combine different insights offered by each technique into a more holistic overview. Figure 14.1 offers a graphical illustration of the idea. The graph includes results of four different instance-level explanation techniques applied to the random-forest model (Section 5.2.2) for the Titanic data (Section 5.1). The instance of interest is Johnny D, an 8-year-old boy who embarked in Southampton and travelled in the first class with no parents nor siblings, and with a ticket costing 72 pounds (Section 5.2.5). Recall that the goal is to predict the probability of survival of Johnny D. The plots in the first row of Figure 14.1 show results of application of various variable-attiribution and variable-importance methods like break-down (BD) plots (Chapter 7), Shapley values (Chapter 9), and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME, see Chapter 10). The results consistently suggest that the most important explanatory variables from a point of view of prediction of the probability of survival for Johnny D are age, gender, class, and fare. Note, however, that the picture offered by the additive decompositions may not be entirely correct, because fare and class are correlated, and there may be an interaction between the efects of age and gender. The plots in the second row of Figure 14.1 show ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles (see Chapter 11) for these four most important explanatory variables for Johnny D. The profiles suggest that increasing age or changing the travel class to the second class or to “restaurant staff” would decrease the predicted probability of survival. On the other hand, decreasing the ticket fare, changing gender to female or changing the travel class to “deck crew” would increase the probability. The plots in the third row of Figure 14.1 summarize univariate distributions of the four explanatory variables. We see, for instance, that the ticket fare of 72 pounds, which was paid for Johnny D’s ticket, was very high and that there were few children among the passengers of Titanic. Figure 14.1 nicely illustrates that perspectives offered by the different techniques complement each other and, when combined, allow obtaining a more profound insight into the origins of the model’s prediction for the instance of interest. Figure 14.1: Results of instance-level-explanation techniques for the random-forest model titanic_rf for the Titanic data and Johnny D. [TOMASZ: STATI FIGURE. CHECK IF CORRECT.] While combining various techniques for instance-level explanation can provide additional insights, it is worth remembering that the techniques are, indeed, different and their suitability may depend on the problem at hand. This is what we discuss in the reaminder of the chapter. 14.2 Number of explanatory variables in the model One of the most important criteria for selection of the exploration and explanation methods is the number of explanatory variables in the model. 14.2.1 Low to medium number of explanatory variables A low number of variables usually implies that the particular variables have a very concrete meaning and interpretation. An example are variables used in models for the Titanic data presented in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.3. In such a situation, the most detailed information about the influence of the variables on a model’s predictions is provided by the CP profiles. In particular, the variables that are most influential for the model’s predictions are selected by considering CP-profile oscillations (see Chapter 12) and then illustrated graphically with the help of individual-variable CP profiles (see Chapter 11). 14.2.2 Medium to large number of explanatory variables In models with a medium or large number of variables, it is still possible that most (or all) of them are interpretable. An example of such a model is a car-insurance pricing model in which we want to estimate the value of an insurance based on behavioral data that includes 100+ variables about characteristics of the driver and characteristics of the car. When the number of explanatory variables increases, it becomes harder to show the CP profile for each individual variable. In such situation, the most common approach is to use BD plots, presented in Chapter 7, or plots of Shapley values, discussed in Chapter 9. They allow a quick evaluation whether a particular variable has got a positive or negative effect on a model’s prediction; we can also assess the size of the effect. If necessary, it is possible to limit the plots only to the variables with the largest effects. 14.2.3 Very large number of explanatory variables When the number of explanatory variables is very large, it may be difficult to interpret the role of each single variable. An example of such situation are models for processing of images or texts. In that case, explanatory variables may be individual pixels in image processing or individual characters in text analysis. As such, their individual interpretation is limited. Due to additional issues with computational complexity, it is not feasible to use CP profiles, BD plots, nor Shapley values to evaluate influence of individual values on a model’s predictions. Instead, the most common approach is to use LIME, presented in Chapter 10, which works on the context-relevant groups of variables. 14.3 Correlated explanatory variables When deriving properties for the methods presented in Part II of this book, we often assumed that explanatory variables are independent. Obviously, this is not always the case. For instance, in the case of the data on apartment prices (see Section 5.4.1), the number of rooms and surface of an apartment will most likely be positively associated. A similar conclusion can be drawn for the travel class and ticket fare for the Titanic data (see Section 5.1.1). Of course, technically speaking, all the presented methods can be applied also when explanatory variables are correlated. However, in such a case the results may be misleading or unrealistic. To address the issue, one could consider creating new variables that would be independent. This is sometimes possible using the application-domain knowledge or by using suitable statistical techniques like principal-components analysis. An alternative is to construct two-dimensional CP plots (see Section 11.5) or permute variables in blocks to preserve the correlation structure of variables when computing Shapley values (see Chapter 9) or BD plots (see Chapter 7). 14.4 Models with interactions In models with interactions, the effect of one explanatory variable may depend on values of other variables. For example, the probability of survival for Titanic passengers may decrease with age, but the effect may be different for different travel classes. In such a case, to explore and explain a model’s predictions, we have got to consider not individual variables, but sets of variables included in interactions. To identify interactions, we can use iBD plots, as described in Chapter 8. To show effects of an interaction, we may use a set of CP profiles. In particular, for the Titanic example, we may use the CP profiles for the age variable for instances that differ only in gender. The less parallel are such profiles, the larger the effect of an interaction. 14.5 Sparse explanations Predictive models may use hundreds of explanatory variables to yield a prediction for a particular instance. However, for a meaningful interpretation and illustration, most of human beings can handle only a very limited (say, less than 10) number of variables. Thus, sparse explanations are of interest. The most common method that is used to construct such explanations is LIME (Chapter 10). However, constructing a sparse explanation for a complex model is not trivial and may be misleading. Hence, care is needed when applying LIME to very complex models. 14.6 Additional uses of model exploration and explanation In the previous chapters of Part II of the book, we focused on the application of the presented methods to exploration and explanation of predictive models. However, the methods can also be used for other purposes: Model improvement/debugging. If a model’s prediction is particularly bad for a selected observation, then the investigation of the reasons for such a bad performance may provide hints about how to improve the model. In case of instance predictions, it is easier to detect that a selected explanatory variable should have a different effect than the observed one. Additional domain-specific validation. Understanding which factors are important for a model’s predictions helps in evaluation of the plausibility of the model. If the effects of some explanatory variables on the predictions are observed to be inconsistent with the domain knowledge, this may provide a ground for criticising the model and, eventually, replacing it by another one. On the other hand, if the influence of the variables on the model’s predictions is consistent with prior expectations, the user may become more confident with the model. Such a confidence is fundamental when the model’s predictions are used as a support for taking decisions that may lead to serious consequences, like in the case of, for example, predictive models in medicine. Model selection. In case of multiple candidate models, one may use results of the model explanation techniques to select one of the candidates. It is possible that, even if two models are similar in terms of a overall performance, one of them may perform much better locally. Consider the following, highly hypothetical example. Assume that a model is sought to predict whether it will rain on a particular day in a region where it rains on a half of the days. Two models are considered: one which simply predicts that it will rain every other day, and another that predicts that it will rain every day since October till March. Arguably, both models are rather unsophisticated (to say the least), but they both predict that, on average, half of the days will be rainy. (We can say that both models are well calibrated; see Section 16.2.) However, investigation of the instance predictions (for individual days) may lead to a preference for one of them. New knowledge extraction. ML models are mainly built for the effectiveness of predictions. As Leo Breiman noted in his work Two Cultures (Leo Breiman 2001b) it is a different style than the modelling based on the understanding of the phenomena that generated values of interests. However, the model explanations sometimes help to extract new and useful knowledge in the field. Especially in areas where there is not much of this domain knowledge yet. 14.7 Comparison of models (champion-challenger analysis) The techniques for explaining and exploring models have many applications. One of them is the opportunity to compare models. There are situations when we may be interested in the “champion-challenger” analysis. Let us assume that some institution uses a predictive model, but wants to know if it could get a better model using other modeling techniques. For example, the risk department in a bank may be using logistic regression to assess credit risk. The model may perform satisfactorily and, hence, be considered as the “champion,” i.e., the best model in the class of logistic-regression models. However, the department may be interested in checking whether a “challenger,” i.e., a more complex model developed by using, for instance, boosting or random trees, will not perform better. And if it is performing better, the question of interest is: how does the challenger differ from the champion? Another reason why we may want to compare models is the fact that the modeling process is iterative itself (see Section 2.2). During the process many versions of models are created, often with different structures, and sometimes with a very similar performance. Comparative analysis allows for better understanding how these models differ from each other. Below we present an example of a comparative analysis for the logistic-regression model titanic_lmr (Section 5.2.1), random-forest model titanic_rf (Section 5.2.2), boosting model of titanic_gbm (Section 5.2.3), and support-vector machine (SVM) model titanic_svm (Section 5.2.4). We consider Johnny D (see Section 5.2.5) as the instance of interest. Note that the models do importantly differ. The random-forest and boosting models are tree-based, with a stepped response (prediction) curve. They are complex due to a large number of trees used for prediction. The logistic regression and SVM models lead to continuous and smooth response curves. Their complexity stems from the fact that the logistic-regression model includes spline transformations, while the SVM model uses a non-linear kernel function. The differences result in different predicted values of the probability of surival for Johnny D. In particular, the predicted value of the probability is equal to 0.42, 0.77, 0.66, and 0.22 for the random-forest, logistic-regression, boosting, and SVM model, respectively (see Section 5.2.5). Figure 14.2 shows the Shapley values (see Chapter 9) for the four models for Johnny D. For the random-forest and logistic-regression models, similar variables are indicated as important: age, class, and gender. Class and gender are also important for the gradient-boosting model, while for the SVM model, the most important variable is gender, followed by age and parch. Figure 14.2: Shapley values for four different models for the Titanic data and Johnny D. As it was mentioned in Chapter 9, Shapley values show additive contributions of explanatory variables to a model’s predictions. However, the values may be misleading if there are interactions. In that case, iBD plots, discussed in Chapter 8, might be more appropriate. Figure 14.3 presents the plots for the four models under consideration. For the SVM model, the most important variable is gender, while for the other models the most imprtant variables are age and class. Remarkably, the iBD plot for the random-forest model includes interaction of fare and class. Figure 14.3: Interaction break-down plots for four different models for the Titanic data and Johnny D. Figure 14.4 shows CP profiles for age and fare and the four compared models. For fare, the logistic-regression and SVM models show little effect. A similar conclusion can be drawn for the boosting model, though for this model the profile shows considerable oscillations. The profile for the random-forest model suggests a decrease in the predicted probability of survival when the ticket fare increases over about 37 pounds. For age, the CP profile for the SVM model shows, again, considerable oscillations. For all the models, however, the effect of the variable is substantial, with the predicted probability of survival decreasing with increasing age. The effect is most pronounced for the logistic-regression model. Figure 14.4: Ceteris-paribus plots for variables age and fare for four different models for the Titanic data and Johnny D. Leo Breiman in his work Two Cultures (Leo Breiman 2001b) described a phenomenon called Rashomon effect. It means that several models with similar performance can base their predictions on a completely different relations extracted from the same data. This is the case with four models presented in this section. Although they are all quite effective, for one particular observation, here Johnny D, they give different predictions and different explanations. We can still read a lot from this jungle of explanations. For example, Ceteris-paribus profiles for GBM techniques generate curves with very high variability (see Figure ??). Such a high fluctuation suggests an overfitting, so I would rather not use this model. Analyzing the Ceteris-paribus profiles for age one can get the impression that the SVM model is very stiff and cannot learn that young people have a better chance of survival (see Figure ??). Other models agree on this. This different behaviour of the SVM model suggests that it was not able to learn something that other models have learned. I wouldn’t use it either. The random forest model is consistent with the logistical regression model. But in the Shap analysis you can see that the attribution of variables is highly variable (see Figure ??). This suggests there are interactions in this model. And since the model has interactions, the additive explanations for individual variables can be misleading. This analysis led us to the conclusion that the safest model to use is a logistic regression model with splines References "],
["modelLevelExploration.html", "15 Introduction to Dataset-level Exploration", " 15 Introduction to Dataset-level Exploration In Part II, we focused on instance-level explainers, which help to understand how does a model yield a prediction for a single observation (instance)? In Part III, we concentrate on dataset-level explainers, which help to understand how do the model predictions perform overall, for an entire set of observations? Assuming that the observations form a representative sample from a general population, model-level explainers can provide an information about the quality of predictions for the population. The following examples illustrate situations in which dataset-level explainers may be useful: We may want to learn which variables are “important” in the model. For instance, we may be interested in predicting the risk of heart attack by using explanatory variables that are derived from results of medical examinations. If some of the variables do not influence predictions, we could simplify the model by removing the variables. We may want to understand how does a selected variable influence the model’s predictions? For instance, we may be interested in predicting prices of apartments. Apartment’s location is an important factor, but we may want to know which locations lead to higher prices? We may want to discover whether there are any observations, for which the model yields wrong predictions. For instance, for a model predicting the probability of survival after a risky treatment, we might want to know whether there are patients for whom the model’s predictions are extremely wrong. Identifying such a group of patients might point to, for instance, an incorrect form of an explanatory variable, or even a missed variable. We may be interested in an overall “performance” of the model. For instance, we may want to compare two models in terms of the average accuracy of their predictions. In all cases, measures capturing a particular aspect of a model’s performance have to be defined. We will discuss them in subsequent chapters. In particular, in Chapter 16, we discuss measures that are useful for the evaluation of the overall performance of a model. In Chapter 17, we focus on methods that allow evaluation of a variable’s effect on a model’s predictions. Chapter 18 and Chapter 19 focus on exploration of the effect of selected variables on predictions. Chapter 20 presents an overview of the classical residual-diagnostics tools. Finally, in Chapter 21, we present an example of an analysis that illustrates the use of the instance- and dataset-level explainers introduced in the book. "],

Some of this information can be extracted from the observed independent variables \\(\\underline X\\), so in modelling we are focused on understanding the conditional distribution of \\(Y|\\underline X\\). We’re trying to approximates expected value with the class of models \\(f(\\underline\\theta; \\underline X)\\). Based on the observed data, we’re constructing the \\(f(\\underline{\\hat\\theta}; \\underline X)\\) model. In this chapter, we present measures that are useful for the evaluation of the overall performance of a predictive model. The quality of prediction can be defined in many ways. Leo Breiman in his fantastic work The Two Cultures (Leo Breiman 2001b) described two main trends, one related to the accuracy of the \\(Y|\\underline X\\) dependency, the other to the effectiveness of prediction. We distinguish between evaluating goodness-of-fit and goodness-of-prediction. In a nutshell, goodness-of-fit (GoF) pertains to the question: how well do the model’s predictions explain (fit) dependent-variable values of the observations used for developing the model? On the other hand, goodness-of-prediction (GoP) is related to the question: how well does the model predict a value of the dependent variable for a new observation? For some measures, their interpretation in terms of GoF or GoP depend on whether they are computed by using training or testing data. The measures may be applied for several purposes, including: model evaluation: we may want to know how good is the model, i.e., how reliable are the model’s predictions (how frequent and how large errors may we expect)?; model comparison: we may want to compare two or more models in order to choose between them; out-of-sample and out-of-time comparisons: we may want to check a model’s performance when applied to new data to evaluate if performance has not worsened. Depending of the nature of the dependent variable (continuous, binary, categorical, count, etc.), different model-performance measures may be used. Moreover, the list of useful measures is growing as new applications emerge. In this chapter, we discuss a selected set of measures, some of which are used in dataset-level exploration techniques introduced in subsequent chapters. 16.2 Intuition Most model-performance measures are based on comparison of the model’s predictions with the (known) values of the dependent variable in a dataset. For an ideal model, the predictions and the dependent-variable values should be equal. In practice, it is never the case, and we want to quantify the disagreement. In principle, model-performance measures may be computed for the training dataset, i.e., the data used for developing the model. However, in that case there is a serious risk that the computed values will overestimate the quality of the model’s predictive performance. A more meaningful approach is to apply the measures to an independent testing dataset. Alternatively, a bias-correction strategy can be used when applying them to the training data. Toward this aim, various strategies have been proposed, such as cross-validation or bootstrapping (Kuhn and Johnson 2013; Harrell 2015; Steyerberg 2019). In what follows, we mainly consider the simple data-split strategy, i.e., we assume that the available data are split into a training set and a testing set. The model is created on the former, and the latter set is used to assess the model’s performance. It is worth mentioning that there are two important aspects of prediction: calibration and discrimination (Harrell, Lee, and Mark 1996). Calibration refers to the extent of bias in predicted values, i.e., the mean difference between the predicted and true values. Discrimination refers to the ability of the predictions to distinguish between individual true values. For instance, consider a model to be used for weather forecasts in a region where, on average, it rains half a year. A simple model that predicts that every other day is rainy is well calibrated because, on average, the resulting predicted risk of a rainy day in a year is 50%, which agrees with the actual situation. However, the model is not very much discriminative (for each calendar day, the probability of a correct prediction is 50%, the same as for a fair-coin toss) and, hence, not very useful. Thus, in addition to overall measures of GoP, we may need separate measures for calibration and discrimination of a model. Note that, for the latter, we may want to weigh differently the situation when the prediction is, for instance, larger than the true value, as compared to the case when it is smaller. Depending on the decision how to weigh different types of disagreement, we may need different measures. In the best possible scenario, we can specify a single model-performance measure before the model is created and then optimize the model for this measure. But the more common scenario in practice is to use several performance measures, which are often selected after the model has been created. 16.3 Method Assume that we have got a training dataset with \\(n\\) observations on \\(p\\) explanatory variables and on a dependent variable \\(Y\\). The dataset is used to develop model \\(f(\\hat {\\underline \\theta}; \\underline X)\\). Let \\(\\underline{x}_i\\) denote the (column) vector of values of the explanatory variables for the \\(i\\)-th observation, and \\(y_i\\) the corresponding value of the dependent variable. We will use \\(\\underline{X}=(x&#39;_1,\\ldots,x&#39;_n)\\) to denote the matrix of explanatory variables for all \\(n\\) observations, and \\(\\underline{y}=(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)&#39;\\) to denote the (column) vector of the values of the dependent variable. Let \\(\\widehat{y}_i=f(\\underline{x}_i)\\) indicate model’s \\(f(\\hat {\\underline \\theta}; \\underline X)\\) prediction corresponding to \\(y_i\\). Some measures of model evaluation are based on a one-leave-out sample. We will use \\(\\widehat{y}_{i(-i)}\\) to denote the prediction obtained for \\(y_i\\) by excluding the \\(i\\)-th observation from the training dataset when fitting the model \\({\\widehat {\\underline {\\theta_{-i}}}}; \\underline {X_{-i}}\\). It’s worth noting here that the \\({\\widehat {\\underline {\\theta_{-i}}}}; \\underline {X_{-i}}\\) model is a different model than the \\(\\hat {\\underline \\theta}; \\underline X\\) model. But it is often assumed that they are close to each other and conclusions about one can be transferred to another. In the subsequent sections, we present various model-performance measures by assuming that they are computed based on a training dataset. The measures are applied in essentially the same way if a testing dataset is used. If there is any difference in the interpretation or properties of the measures between the two siutations, we will explicitly mention them. 16.3.1 Continuous dependent variable 16.3.1.1 Goodness-of-fit The most popular GoF measure for models for a continuous dependent variable is the mean squared-error, defined as \\[\\begin{equation} MSE(f,\\underline{X},\\underline{y}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i}^{n} (\\widehat{y}_i - y_i)^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i}^{n} r_i^2, \\tag{16.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r_i\\) is the residual for the \\(i\\)-th observation (see also Section 2.3). Thus, MSE can be seen as a sum of squared residuals. MSE is a convex differentiable function, which is important from an optimization point of view (see Section 2.5). As the measure weighs all differences equally, large residuals have got a high impact on MSE. Thus, the measure is sensitive to outliers. For a “perfect” model, which predicts (fits) all \\(y_i\\) exactly, \\(MSE = 0\\). Note that MSE is constructed on a different scale than the dependent variable. Thus, a more interpretable variant of this measure is the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE), defined as \\[\\begin{equation} RMSE(f, \\underline{X}, \\underline{y}) = \\sqrt{MSE(f, \\underline{X}, \\underline{y})}. \\tag{16.2} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 16.1: The distribution of the residuals in the Random Forest model for the Titanic data. The red dot indicates RMSE. A popular variant of RMSE is its normalized version, \\(R^2\\), defined as \\[\\begin{equation} R^2(f, \\underline{X}, \\underline{y}) = 1 - \\frac{MSE(f, \\underline{X}, \\underline{y})}{MSE(f_0, \\underline{X},\\underline{y})}. \\tag{16.3} \\end{equation}\\] In (16.3), \\(f_0()\\) denotes a “baseline” model. For instance, in the case of the classical linear regression, \\(f_0()\\) is the model that includes only the intercept, which implies the use of the mean value of \\(Y\\) as a prediction for all observations. \\(R^2\\) is normalized in the sense that the “perfectly” fitting model leads to \\(R^2 = 1\\), while \\(R^2 = 0\\) means that we are not doing better than the baseline model. In the context of the classical linear regression, \\(R^2\\) is the familiar coefficient of determination and can be interpreted as the fraction of the total variance of \\(Y\\) “explained” by model \\(f()\\). Given sensitivity of MSE to outliers, sometimes the median absolute-deviation (MAD) is considered: \\[\\begin{equation} MAD(f, \\underline{X} ,\\underline{y}) = median( |r_1|, ..., |r_n| ). \\tag{16.4} \\end{equation}\\] MAD is more robust to outliers than MSE. A disadvantage of MAD are its less favorable mathematical properties. 16.3.1.2 Goodness-of-prediction Assume that a testing dataset is available. In that case, we can use the estimated form of model \\(f()\\), obtained by fitting the model to training data, to predict the values of the dependent variable observed in the testing dataset. Subsequently, we can compute MSE as in (16.1) to obtain the mean squared-prediction-error (MSPE) as a GoP measure (Kutner et al. 2005). By taking the square root of MSPE, we get the root-mean-squared-prediction-error (RMSPE). In the absence of testing data, one of the most known GoP measures for models for a continuous dependent variable is the predicted sum-of-squares (PRESS), defined as \\[\\begin{equation} PRESS(f,\\underline{X},\\underline{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\widehat{y}_{i(-i)} - y_i)^2. \\tag{16.5} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, PRESS can be seen as a result of application of the leave-one-out strategy to the evaluation of GoP of a model using the training data. Note that, for the cassical linear-regression model, there is no need to re-fit the model \\(n\\) times to compute PRESS (Kutner et al. 2005). Based on PRESS, one can define the predictive squared-error \\(PSE=PRESS/n\\) and the standard deviation error in prediction \\(SEP=\\sqrt{PSE}=\\sqrt{PRESS/n}\\) (Todeschini 2020). Another measure gaining in popularity is \\[\\begin{equation} Q^2(f,\\underline{X},\\underline{y}) = 1- \\frac{ PRESS(f,\\underline{X},\\underline{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} ({y}_{i} - \\bar{y})^2}. \\tag{16.6} \\end{equation}\\] It is sometimes called the cross-validated \\(R^2\\) or the coefficient of prediction (Landram, Abdullat, and Shah 2005). It appears that \\(Q^2 \\leq R^2\\), i.e., the expected accuracy of out-of-sample predictions measured by \\(Q^2\\) cannot exceed the accuracy of in-sample estimates (Landram, Abdullat, and Shah 2005). For a “perfect” predictive model, \\(Q^2=1\\). It is worth noting that, while \\(R^2\\) always increases if an explanatory variable is added to a model, \\(Q^2\\) decreases when “noisy” variables are added to the model (Todeschini 2020). The aforementioned measures capture the overall predictive performance of a model. A measure aimed at evaluating discrimination is the concordance (c) index (Harrell, Lee, and Mark 1996; Brentnall and Cuzick 2018). It is computed by considering all pairs of observations and computing the fraction of the pairs in which the ordering of the predictions corresponds to the ordering of the true values (Brentnall and Cuzick 2018). The index assumes the value of 1 in case of perfect discrimination and 0.25 for random discrimination. Calibration can be assessed by a scatter plot of the predicted values of \\(Y\\) in fuction of the true ones (Harrell, Lee, and Mark 1996; van Houwelingen, H.C. 2000; Steyerberg et al. 2010). The plot can be characterized by its intercept and slope. In case of perfect prediction, the plot should assume the form of a straight line with intercept 0 and slope 1. A deviation of the intercept from 0 indicates overall bias in predictions (“calibration-in-the-large”), while the value of the slope smaller than 1 suggests overfitting of the model (van Houwelingen, H.C. 2000; Steyerberg et al. 2010). The estimated values of the coefficients can be used to re-calibrate the model (van Houwelingen, H.C. 2000). 16.3.2 Binary dependent variable To introduce model-performance measures, we, somewhat arbitrarily, label the two possible values of the dependent variable as “success” and “failure.” Of course, in a particular application, the meaning of the “success” outcome does not have to be positive nor optimistic; for a diagnostic test, “success” often means detection of a disease. We also assume that model prediction \\(f(\\underline{x})\\) takes the form of the predicted probability of success. 16.3.2.1 Goodness-of-fit If we assign the value of 1 to success and 0 to failure, it is possible to use MSE, RMSE, and MAE, as defined in Equations (16.1), (16.2), (16.4), respectively, as a GoF measure. In fact, the MSE obtained in that way is equivalent to the Brier score, which can be also expressed as \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} [y_i\\{1-f(\\underline{x}_i)\\}^2+(1-y_i)\\{f(\\underline{x}_i)\\}^2]/n. \\] Its minimum value is 0 for a “perfect” model and 0.25 for an “uninformative” model that yields the predicted probability of 0.5 for all observations. The Brier score is often also interpreted as an overall predictive-performance measure for models for a binary dependent variable, because it captures both calibration and the concentration of the predictive distribution (Rufibach 2010). One of the main issues related to the summary measures based on MSE is that they penalize too mildly for wrong predictions. In fact, the maximum penalty for an individual prediction is equal to 1 (if, for instance, the model yields zero probability for an actual success). To address this issue, the log-likelihood function based on the Bernoulli distribution (see also (2.8)) can be considered: \\[\\begin{equation} l(f, \\underline{X},\\underline{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} [y_i \\ln\\{f(\\underline{x}_i)\\}+ (1-y_i) \\ln\\{1-f(\\underline{x}_i)\\}]. \\tag{16.7} \\end{equation}\\] Note that, in the machine-learning world, function \\(-l(f, \\underline{X} ,\\underline{y})/n\\) is often considered (sometimes also with \\(\\ln\\) replaced by \\(\\log_2\\)) and termed “log-loss” or “cross-entropy.” The log-likelihood heavily “penalizes” the cases when the model-predicted probability of success \\(f(\\underline{x}_i)\\) is high for an actual failure (\\(y_i=0\\)) and low for an actual success (\\(y_i=1\\)). The log-likelihood (16.7) can be used to define \\(R^2\\)-like measures (for a review, see, for example, Allison (2014)). One of the variants most often used is the measure proposed by Nagelkerke (1991): \\[\\begin{equation} R_{bin}^2(f, \\underline{X}, \\underline{y}) = \\frac{1-e^{\\frac{2}{n}\\{l(f_0, \\underline{X},\\underline{y})-l(f, \\underline{X},\\underline{y})\\}}} {1-e^{\\frac{2}{n}l(f_0, \\underline{X},\\underline{y})}} . \\tag{16.8} \\end{equation}\\] It shares properties of the “classical” \\(R^2\\), defined in (16.3). In (16.8), \\(f_0()\\) denotes the model that includes only the intercept, which implies the use of the observed fraction of successes as the predicted probability of success. If we denote the fraction by \\(\\hat{p}\\), then \\[ l(f_0, \\underline{X},\\underline{y}) = n \\hat{p} \\ln{\\hat{p}} + n(1-\\hat{p}) \\ln{(1-\\hat{p})}. \\] 16.3.2.2 Goodness-of-prediction In many situations, consequences of a prediction error depend on the form of the error. For this reason, performance measures based on the (estimated values of) probability of correct/wrong prediction are more often used. To introduce some of those measures, we assume that, for each observation from the testing dataset, the predicted probability of success \\(f(\\underline{x}_i)\\) is compared to a fixed cut-off threshold, \\(C\\) say. If the probability is larger than \\(C\\), then we assume that the model predicts success; otherwise, we assume that it predicts failure. As a result of such a procedure, the comparison of the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable for the \\(n\\) observations in a dataset can be summarized in the following table: True value: success True value: failure Total \\(f(\\underline{x}) &gt; C\\), predicted: success True Positive: \\(TP_C\\) False Positive (type I error): \\(FP_C\\) \\(P_C\\) \\(f(\\underline{x}) \\leq C\\), predicted: failure False Negative (type II error): \\(FN_C\\) True Negative: \\(TN_C\\) \\(N_C\\) Total \\(S\\) \\(F\\) \\(n\\) In machine-learning world, the table is often referred to as the “confusion table” or “confusion matrix.” In statistics, it is often called the “decision table.” The counts \\(TP_C\\) and \\(TN_C\\) on the diagonal of the table correspond to the cases when the predicted and observed value of the dependent variable \\(Y\\) coincide. \\(FP_C\\) is the number of cases in which failure is predicted as success. These are false-positive, or type I error, cases. On the other hand, \\(FN_C\\) is the count of false-negative, or type II error, cases, in which success is predicted as failure. Marginally, there are \\(P_C\\) predicted successes and \\(N_C\\) predicted failures, with \\(P_C+N_C=n\\). In the testing dataset, there are \\(S\\) observed successes and \\(F\\) observed failures, with \\(S+N=n\\). Let’s illustrate the “confusion table” based on an example of pregnancy detectionwith a very simple pregnancy test - morning sickness. The table below shows a sample population of 1000 women aged 20-30 years. Information about the sensitivity and specificity of the test is taken from (Bastian and Piscitelli 1997). True value: pregnant True value: not pregnant Prevalence: 10% Morning Sickness 39 150 Precision: 20.6% Lack of Morning Sickness 61 850 NPV: 93.3% Recall, Sensitivity: 39.0% Specificity: 85.0% Accuracy: 80.8%, F1: 26.9% The effectiveness of such a test can be described by various measures. Let us present some of the most popular examples. The simplest measure of model performance is accuracy, defined as \\[ ACC_C = \\frac{TP_C+TN_C}{n}. \\] It is the fraction of correct predictions in the entire testing dataset. Accuracy is of interest if true positives and true negatives are more important than their false counterparts. However, accuracy may not be very informative when one of the binary categories is much more prevalent (so called unbalanced labels). For example, if the testing data contain 90% of successes, a model that would always predict a success would reach accuracy of 0.9, although one could argue that this is not a very useful model. There may be situations when false positives and/or false negatives may be of more concern. In that case, one might want to keep their number low. Hence, other measures, focused on the false results, might be of interest. In the machine-learning world, two other measures are often considered: precision and recall. Precision is defined as \\[ Precision_C = \\frac{TP_C}{TP_C+FP_C} = \\frac{TP_C}{P_C}. \\] Precision is also referred to as the positive predictive value. It is the fraction of correct predictions among the predicted successes. Precision is high if the number of false positives is low. Thus, it is a useful measure when the penalty for committing the type I error (false positive) is high. For instance, consider the use of a genetic test in cancer diagnostics, with a positive result of the test taken as an indication of an increased risk of developing a cancer. A false-positive result of a genetic test might mean that a person would have to unnecessarily cope with emotions and, possibly, medical procedures related to the fact of being evaluated as having a high risk of developing a cancer. We might want to avoid this situation more than the false-negative case. The latter would mean that the genetic test gives a negative result for a person that, actually, might be at an increased risk of developing a cancer. However, an increased risk does not mean that the person will develop cancer. And even so, we could hope that we could detect it in due time. Recall is defined as \\[ Recall_C = \\frac{TP_C}{TP_C+FN_C} = \\frac{TP_C}{S_C}. \\] Recall is also referred to as sensitivity or the true-positive rate. It is the fraction of correct predictions among the true successes. Recall is high if the number of false negatives is low. Thus, it is a useful measure when the penalty for committing the type II error (false negative) is high. For instance, consider the use of an algorithm that predicts whether a bank transaction is fraudulent. A false-negative result means that the algorithm accepts a fraudulent transaction as a legitimate one. Such a decision may have immediate and unpleasant consequences for the bank, because it may imply a non-recoverable loss of money. On the other hand, a false-positive result means that a legitimate transaction is considered as fraudulent one and is blocked. However, upon further checking, the legitimate nature of the transaction can be confirmed with, perhaps, annoyed client as the only consequence for the bank. The harmonic mean of these two measures defines the F1 score: \\[ F1\\ score_C = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{Precision_C} + \\frac{1}{Recall_C}} = 2\\cdot\\frac{Precision_C \\cdot Recall_C}{Precision_C + Recall_C}. \\] F1 score tends to give a low value if either precision or recall is low, and a high value if both precision and recall are high. For instance, if precision is 0, F1 score will also be 0 irrespectively of the value of recall. Thus, it is a useful measure if we have got to seek a balance between precision and recall. In statistics, and especially in applications in medicine, the popular measures are sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is simply another name for recall. Specificity is defined as \\[ Specificity_C = \\frac{TN_C}{TN_C + FP_C} = \\frac{TN_C}{F_C}. \\] Specificity is also referred to as the true-negative rate. It is the fraction of correct predictions among the true failures. Specificity is high if the number of false positives is low. Thus, as precision, it is a useful measure when the penalty for committing the type I error (false positive) is high. The reason why sensitivity and specificity may be more often used outside the machine-learning world is related to the fact that their values do not depend on the proportion \\(S/n\\) (sometimes termed prevalence) of true successes. This means that, once estimated in a sample obtained from a population, they may be applied to other populations, in which the prevalence may be different. This is not true for precision, because one can write \\[ Precision_C = \\frac{Sensitivity_C \\cdot \\frac{S}{n}}{Sensitivity_C \\cdot \\frac{S}{n}+Specificity_C \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{S}{n}\\right)}. \\] All the measures depend on the choice of cut-off \\(C\\). To assess the form and the strength of dependence, a common approach is to construct the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The curve plots \\(Sensitivity_C\\) in function of \\(1-Specificity_C\\) for all possible, ordered values of \\(C\\). Figure 16.2 presents the ROC curve for the random-forest model for the Titanic dataset (see Section 5.2.2). Note that the curve indicates an inverse relationship between sensitivity and specificity: by increasing one measure, the other is decreased. Figure 16.2: Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for the random-forest model for the Titanic dataset. The Gini coefficient can be calculated as 2 x area between the ROC curve and the diagonal (this area is highlighted). The AUC (Area Under Curve) coefficient is defined as an area under the ROC curve. The ROC curve is very informative. For a model that predicts successes and failures at random, the corresponding curve will be equal to the diagonal line. On the other hand, for a model that yields perfect predictions, the ROC curve reduces to a two intervals that connect points (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1). Often, there is a need to summarize the ROC curve and, hence, model’s performance. A popular measure that is used toward this aim is the area under the curve (AUC). For a model that predicts successes and failures at random, AUC is the area under the diagonal line, i.e., it is equal to 0.5. For a model that yields perfect predictions, AUC is equal to 1. It appears that, in this case, AUC is equivalent to the c-index (see Section 16.3.1.2). A variant of ROC curve based on Precison and Recall measures is PRC (Precision Recall Curve). An example of this curve is shown in 16.3. Figure 16.3: Precision Recall Curve for the random-forest model for the Titanic dataset. Another ROC-curve-based measure that is often used is the Gini coefficient \\(G\\). It is closely related to AUC; in fact, it can be calculated as \\(G = 2 \\times AUC - 1\\). For a model that predicts successes and failures at random, \\(G=0\\); for a perfect-prediction model, \\(G = 1\\). The value of the Gini coefficient or, equivalently, of \\(AUC-0.5\\) allows a comparison of the model-based predictions with random guessing. A measure that explicitly compares a prediction model with a baseline (or null) model is the lift. Commonly, random guessing is considered as the baseline model. In that case, \\[ Lift_C = \\frac{\\frac{TP_C}{P_C}}{\\frac{S}{n}} = n\\frac{Precision_C}{S}. \\] Note that \\(S/n\\) can be seen as the estimated probability of a correct prediction of a success for random guessing. On the other hand, \\(TP_C/P_C\\) is the estimated probability of a correct prediction of a success given that the model predicts a success. Hence, informally speaking, the lift indicates how many more (or less) times does the model do better in predicting success as compared to random guessing. As other measures, the lift depends on the choice of cut-off \\(C\\). The plot of the lift as a function of \\(P_C\\) is called the lift chart. See an example in Figure 16.4. Figure 16.4: Lift Curve for the random-forest model for the Titanic dataset. Calibration of predictions can be assessed by a scatter plot of the predicted values of \\(Y\\) in fuction of the true ones. A complicating issue is the fact that the true values are only equal to 0 or 1. Therefore, smoothing techinques or grouping of observations is needed to obtain a meaningful plot (Steyerberg et al. 2010; Steyerberg 2019). There are many more measures aimed at measuring performance of a predictive model for a binary dependent variable. An overview can be found in, e.g., Berrar (2019). 16.3.3 Categorical dependent variable To introduce model-performance measures for a categorical dependent variable, we assume that \\(\\underline{y}_i\\) is now a vector of \\(K\\) elements. Each element \\(y_{i}^k\\) (\\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\)) is a binary variable indicating whether the \\(k\\)-th category was observed for the \\(i\\)-th observation. We assume that, for each observation, only one category can be observed. Thus, all elements of \\(\\underline{y}_i\\) are equal to 0 except of one that is equal to 1. Furthermore, we assume that a model’s prediction takes the form of a vector of the predicted probabilities for each of the \\(K\\) categories, with \\(f(\\underline{x}_i)^k\\) denoting the probability for the \\(k\\)-th category. The predicted category is the one with the highest predicted probability. 16.3.3.1 Goodness-of-fit The log-likelihood function (16.7) can be adapted to the categorical dependent variable case as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} l(f, \\underline{X} ,\\underline{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{i}^k \\ln\\left\\{f(\\underline{x}_i)^k\\right\\}. \\tag{16.9} \\end{equation}\\] It is essentially the log-likelihood function based on a multinomial distribution. Based on the likelihood, an \\(R^2\\)-like measure can be defined, using an approach similar to the one used in (16.8) for construction of \\(R_{bin}^2\\) (Harrell 2015). 16.3.3.2 Goodness-of-prediction It is possible to extend measures like accuracy, precision, etc., introduced in Section 16.3.2 for a binary dependent variable, to the case of a categorical one. Toward this end, first, a confusion table is created for each category \\(k\\), treating the category as “success” and all other categories as “failure.” Let us denote the counts in the table by \\(TP_k\\), \\(FP_k\\), \\(TN_k\\), and \\(FN_k\\). Based on the counts, we can compute the average accuracy across all classes as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\overline{ACC_C} = \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k=1}^K\\frac{TP_{C,k}+TN_{C,k}}{n}. \\tag{16.10} \\end{equation}\\] Similarly, one could compute the average precision, average sensitivity, etc. In machine-learning world, this approach is often termed “macro-averaging” (Sokolva and Lapalme 2009; Tsoumakas, Katakis, and Vlahavas 2010). The averages computed in that way treat all classes equally. An alternative approach is to sum the appropriate counts from the confusion tables for all classes, and then form a measure based on the so-computed cumulative counts. For instance, for precision, this would lead to \\[\\begin{equation} \\overline{Precision_C}_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^K TP_{C,k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^K (TP_{C,k}+FP_{C,k})}. \\tag{16.11} \\end{equation}\\] In machine-learning world, this approach is often termed “micro-averaging” (Sokolva and Lapalme 2009; Tsoumakas, Katakis, and Vlahavas 2010), hence subscript \\(\\mu\\) for “micro” in (16.11). Note that, for accuracy, this computation still leads to (16.10). The measures computed in that way favor classes with larger numbers of observations. 16.3.4 Count dependent variable In case of counts, one could consider using MSE or any of the measures for a continuous dependent variable mentioned in Section 16.3.1.1. However, a particular feature of count dependent variables is that their variance depends on the mean value. Consequently, weighing all contributions to MSE equally, as in (16.1), is not appropriate, because the same residual value \\(r_i\\) indicates a larger discrepancy for a smaller count \\(y_i\\) than for a larger one. Therefore, a popular measure of performance of a predictive model for counts is Pearson’s statistic: \\[\\begin{equation} \\chi^2(f,\\underline{X},\\underline{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left\\{\\frac{f(\\underline{x}_i) - y_i}{\\sqrt{f(\\underline{x}_i)}}\\right\\}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left\\{\\frac{r_i}{\\sqrt{f(\\underline{x}_i)}}\\right\\}^2. \\tag{16.12} \\end{equation}\\] From (16.12) it is clear that, if the same residual is obtained for two different observed counts, it is assigned a larger weight for the count for which the predicted value is smaller. Of course, there are more measures of model performance as well as types of model responses (e.g. censored data). A complete list, even if it could be created, would be beyond the scope of this book. 16.4 Example 16.4.1 Apartment prices Let us consider the linear-regression model apartments_lm (see Section 5.5.1) and the random-forest model apartments_rf (see Section 5.5.2) for the apartment-prices data (see Section 5.4). Recall that, for these data, the dependent variable, the price per square meter, is continuous. Hence, we can use the performance measures presented in Section 16.3.1. In particular, we consider MSE and RMSE. The values of the two measures, computed for the apartments_test testing dataset (see Section 5.5.4) for the two models, are presented below. ## Model label: Linear Regression v5 ## score name ## mse 80137.98 mse ## rmse 283.0865 rmse ## Model label: Random Forest v5 ## score name ## mse 80061.77 mse ## rmse 282.952 rmse MSE and its relative RMSE suggest that the random-forest model is slightly better. But is this difference relevant? It should be remembered that the random-forest model has a random component in model construction. It turns out that on the same data when a random forest model is trained with different random seeds several times, the MSE of the forest will be sometimes higher and sometimes lower. So we rather consider that these two models have similar effectiveness and neither of them is clearly better. Figure 16.5: The distribution of the residuals in the Random Forest model for the Titanic data. The red dot indicates RMSE. Figure 16.6: The histogram of the residuals in the Random Forest model and Linear Regression model for the Titanic data. 16.4.2 Titanic data Let us consider the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) and the logistic-regression model titanic_lmr (see Section 5.2.1) for the Titanic data (see Section 5.1). Recall that, for these data, the dependent variable is binary, with success defined as survival of the passenger. First, we take a look at the AUC, F1 score, and accuracy for the models. ## Model label: Logistic Regression v6 ## score name ## auc : 0.81741 ## f1 : 0.6582278 ## accuracy : 0.8042592 ## Model label: Random Forest v6 ## auc : 0.8595467 ## f1 : 0.7412245 ## accuracy : 0.8563661 Overall, the random-forest model is performing better, as indicated by the larger values of all the measures. Figure 16.7 presents ROC curves for both models. The curve for the random-forest model lies above the one for the logistic-regression model for the majority of the cut-offs \\(C\\), except for the very high values of of cut-off \\(C\\). Figure 16.7: Receiver Operating Characteristic curves for the random-forest and logistic-regression models for the Titanic dataset. Figure 16.8 presents lift charts for both models. Also in this case the curve for the random-forest suggests a better performance than for the logistic-regression model, except for the very high values of cut-off \\(C\\). Figure 16.8: Lift charts for the random-forest and logistic-regression models for the Titanic dataset. 16.5 Pros and cons All model-performance measures presented in this chapter are subject to some limitations. For that reason, many measures are available, as the limitations of a particular measure were addressed by developing an alternative one. For instance, RMSE is frequently used and reported for linear-regression models. However, as it is sensitive to outliers, MAD has been proposed as an alternative. In case of predictive models for a binary dependent variable, the measures like accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity are often considered, depending on the consequences of correct/incorrect predictions in a particular application. However, the value of those measures depends on the cut-off value used for creating the predictions. For this reason, ROC curve and AUC have been developed and have become very popular. They are not easily extended to the case of a categorical dependent variable, though. Given the advantages and disadvantages of various measures, and the fact that each may reflect a different aspect of the predictive performance of a model, it is customary to report and compare several of them when evaluating a model’s performance. 16.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present model performance metrics as implemented in the DALEX package for R. The package covers the most often used measures and methods presented in this chapter. More advanced measures of performance are available in the auditor R package (Gosiewska and Biecek 2018). Note that there are also other R packages that offer similar functionality. These include, for instance, packages mlr (Bischl et al. 2016), caret (Jed Wing et al. 2016), tidymodels (Max and Wickham 2018), and ROCR (Sing et al. 2005). For illustration purposes, we use the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) and the logistic-regression model titanic_lmr (see Section 5.2.1) for the Titanic data (see Section 5.1). Consequently, the DALEX functions are applied in the context of a binary classification problem. However, the same functions can be used for, for instance, linear-regression models. To illustrate the use of the functions, we first retrieve the titanic_lmr and titanic_rf model-objects via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.2.7. We also retrieve the version of the titanic data with imputed missing values. titanic_imputed &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/27e5c&quot;) titanic_lmr &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/58b24&quot;) titanic_rf &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/4e0fc&quot;) Then we construct the explainers for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). We also load the rms and randomForest packages, as the models were fitted by using functions from those packages and it is important to have the corresponding predict() functions available. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) library(&quot;rms&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) explain_lmr &lt;- explain(model = titanic_lmr, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Logistic Regression&quot;) explain_lmr$model_info$type = &quot;classification&quot; explain_rf &lt;- explain(model = titanic_rf, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;) Function model_performance() calculates, by default, a set of selected model-performance measures. These include MSE, RMSE, \\(R^2\\), and MAD for linear-regression models, and recall, precision, F1, accuracy, and AUC for models for a binary dependent variable. The function includes the cutoff argument that allows specifying the cut-off value for the measures that require it, i.e., recall, precision, F1 score, and accuracy. By default, the cut-off value is set at 0.5. Note that, by default, all measures are computed for the data that are extracted from the explainer object; these can be training or testing data. eva_rf &lt;- DALEX::model_performance(explain_rf) eva_rf ## Measures for: classification ## recall : 0.6385373 ## precision : 0.8832685 ## f1 : 0.7412245 ## accuracy : 0.8563661 ## auc : 0.8595467 ## ## Residuals: ## 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% ## -0.8920 -0.1140 -0.0240 -0.0080 -0.0040 0.0000 0.0000 0.0100 0.1400 0.5892 ## 100% ## 1.0000 eva_lr &lt;- DALEX::model_performance(explain_lmr) eva_lr ## Measures for: classification ## recall : 0.5850914 ## precision : 0.7522604 ## f1 : 0.6582278 ## accuracy : 0.8042592 ## auc : 0.81741 ## ## Residuals: ## 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% ## -0.98457244 -0.31904861 -0.23408037 -0.20311483 -0.15200813 -0.10318060 ## 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% ## -0.06933478 0.05858024 0.29306442 0.73666519 0.97151255 Application of the DALEX::model_performance() function returns an object of class “model_performance” which includes estimated values of several model-performance measures, as well as a data frame containing the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable together with their difference, i.e., residuals. ROC curve or lift chart can be constructed by applying the generic plot() function to the object. The type of the required plot is indicated by using argument geom. In particular, the argument allows values geom = \"lift\" for lift charts, geom = \"roc\" for ROC curves, geom = \"histogram\" for histograms of residuals, and geom = \"boxplot\" for box-and-whisker plots of residuals. The plot() function returns a ggplot2 object. It is possible to apply the function to more than one object. In that case, the plots for the models corresponding to each object are combined in one graph. In the code below, we create two ggplot2 objects: one for a graph containing Precision-recall curves for both models and one for a histograms for residuals. Subsequently, we use the patchwork package to combine the graphs in one display. p1 &lt;- plot(eva_rf, eva_lr, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;) p2 &lt;- plot(eva_rf, eva_lr, geom = &quot;prc&quot;) library(&quot;patchwork&quot;) p1 + p2 Figure 16.9: Recision recall curve and histogram for residuals obtained by the generic plot() function for the logistic-regression model titanic_lmr and the random-forest model titanic_rf for the Titanic dataset. The resulting graph 16.9 supplement the ROC and Lift plots presented in Figures 16.7 and 16.8 in which two models are compared against each other. 16.7 Code snippets for Python In this section, we use the dalex library for Python. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on pip and GitHub. For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.3.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. In the first step we create an Explainer, an object that will provide a uniform interface for the predictive model. We use the Explainer constructor for this purpose. import pandas as pd henry = pd.DataFrame({&#39;gender&#39;: [&#39;male&#39;], &#39;age&#39;: [47], &#39;class&#39;: [&#39;1st&#39;], &#39;embarked&#39;: [&#39;Southampton&#39;], &#39;fare&#39;: [25], &#39;sibsp&#39;: [0], &#39;parch&#39;: [0]}, index = [&#39;Henry&#39;]) import dalex as dx titanic_rf_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_rf, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic RF Pipeline&quot;) To calculate the model performance one can use the model_performance method. mp_rf = exp_rf.model_performance(model_type = &quot;classification&quot;, cutoff = 0.5) mp_rf.result The resulting object can be visualised with the plot method. mp_rf.plot() References "],

The method may be applied for several purposes. Model simplification: variables that do not influence a model’s predictions may be excluded from the model. Model exploration: comparison of variables’ importance in different models may help in discovering interrelations between the variables. Also, ordering of variables in function of their importance is helpful in deciding in which order should we perform further model exploration. Domain-knowledge-based model validation: identification of the most important variables may be helpful in assessing the validity of the model based on the domain knowledge. Knowledge generation: identification of the most important variables may lead to discovery of new factors involved in a particular mechanism. The methods for assessment of variable importance can be divided, in general, into two groups: model-specific and model-agnostic. For linear models and many other types of models, there are methods of assessing of explanatory variable’s importance that exploit particular elements of the structure of the model. These are model-specific methods. For instance, for linear models, one can use the value of the normalized regression coefficient or its corresponding p-value as the variable-importance measure. For tree-based ensembles, such a measure may be based on the use of a particular variable in particular trees (a great example is the variable importance measure based on out-of-bag data for a random forest model (Leo Breiman 2001a), but there are also other approaches like methods implemented in the XgboostExplainer package (Foster 2017) for gradient boosting and randomForestExplainer (Paluszynska and Biecek 2017) for random forest). In this book, we focus on a model-agnostic method that does not assume anything about the model structure. Therefore, it can be applied to any predictive model or ensemble of models. Moreover, and perhaps even more importantly, it allows comparing an explanatory-variable’s importance between models with different structures. 17.2 Intuition We focus on the method described in more detail by Fisher, Rudin, and Dominici (2018). The main idea is to measure how much does a model’s performance change if the effect of a selected explanatory variable, or of a group of variables, is removed? To remove the effect, we use perturbations, like resampling from an empirical distribution or permutation of the values of the variable. The idea is borrowed from the variable-importance measure proposed by Leo Breiman (2001a) for random forest. If a variable is important, then we expect that, after permuting the values of the variable, the model’s performance (as captured by one of the measures discussed in Chapter 16) will worsen. The larger the change in the performance, the more important is the variable. Despite the simplicity of the idea, permutation-based-approach to measuring an explanatory-variable’s importance is a very powerful model-agnostic tool for model exploration. Variable-importance measures obtained in this way may be compared between different models. This property is discussed in detail in Section 17.5. 17.3 Method Consider a set of \\(n\\) observations for a set of \\(p\\) explanatory variables and dependent variable \\(Y\\). Let \\(\\underline{X}\\) denote the matrix containing, in rows, the (transposed column-vectors of) observed values of the explanatory variables for all observations. Denote by \\(\\underline{y}\\) the column vector of the observed values of \\(Y\\). Let \\(\\hat{\\underline{y}}=(f(\\underline{x}_1),\\ldots,f(\\underline{x}_n))&#39;\\) denote the corresponding vector of predictions for \\(\\underline{y}\\) for model \\(f()\\). Let \\(\\mathcal L(\\hat{\\underline{y}}, \\underline X, \\underline{y})\\) be a loss function that quantifies goodness-of-fit of model \\(f()\\). For instance, \\(\\mathcal L()\\) may be the value of log-likelihood (see Chapter 16) or any other model performance measure discussed in previous chapter. Consider the following algorithm: Compute \\(L^0 = \\mathcal L(\\hat{\\underline{y}}, \\underline X, \\underline{y})\\), i.e., the value of the loss function for the original data. Then, for each explanatory variable \\(X^j\\) included in the model, do steps 2-5. Create matrix \\(\\underline{X}^{*j}\\) by permuting the \\(j\\)-th column of \\(\\underline{X}\\), i.e., by permuting the vector of observed values of \\(X^j\\). Compute model predictions \\(\\hat{\\underline{y}}^{*j}\\) based on the modified data \\(\\underline{X}^{*j}\\). Compute the value of the loss function for the modified data: \\[ L^{*j} = \\mathcal L(\\hat{\\underline{y}}^{*j}, \\underline{X}^{*j}, \\underline{y}). \\] Quantify the importance of \\(X^j\\) by calculating \\(vip_{Diff}^j = L^{*j} - L^0\\) or \\(vip_{Ratio}^j = L^{*j} / L^0\\). Note that the use of resampling or permuting data in Step 2 involves randomness. Thus, the results of the procedure may depend on the obtained configuration of resampled/permuted values. Hence, it is advisable to repeat the procedure several (many) times. In this way, the uncertainty associated with the calculated variable-importance values can be assessed. The calculations in Step 5 “normalize” the value of the variable-importance measure with respect to \\(L^0\\). However, given that \\(L^0\\) is a constant, the normalization has no effect on the ranking of explanatory variables according to \\(vip_{Diff}^j\\) nor \\(vip_{Ratio}^j\\). Thus, in practice, often the values of \\(L^{*j}\\) are simply used to quantify a variable’s importance. 17.4 Example: Titanic data In this section, we illustrate the use of the permutation-based variable-importance evaluation by applying it to the random-forest model for the Titanic data (see Section 5.2.2). Recall that the goal is to predict survival probability of passengers based on their gender, age, class in which they travelled, ticket fare, the number of persons they travelled with, and the harbor they embarked the ship on. We use the area under the ROC curve (AUC, see Section 16.3.2.2) as the model-performance measure. Figure 17.1 shows, for each explanatory variable included in the model, the values of \\(1-AUC^{*j}\\) obtained by the algorithm described in the previous section. Additionally, the plot indicates the value of \\(L^0\\) by the vertical dashed-line at the left-hand-side of the plot. The lengths of the bars correspond to \\(vip_{Diff}^j\\) and provide the variable-importance measures. Figure 17.1: Single-permutation-based variable-importance measures for the explanatory variables included in the random-forest model for the Titanic data using 1-AUC as the loss function. The plot in Figure 17.1 suggests that the most important variable in the model is gender. This agrees with the conclusions drawn in the exploratory analysis presented in Section 5.1.1. The next three important variables are class (first-class patients had a higher chance of survival), age (children had a higher chance of survival), and fare (owners of more expensive tickets had a higher chance of survival). To take into account the uncertainty related to the use of permutations, we can consider computing the mean values of \\(L^{*j}\\) over a set of, say, 10 permutations. The plot in Figure 17.2 presents the mean values. The only remarkable difference, as compared to Figure 17.1, is the change in the ordering of the sibsp and parch variables. Figure 17.2: Means (over 10 permutations) of permutation-based variable-importance measures for the explanatory variables included in the random-forest model for the Titanic data using 1-AUC as the loss function. Plots similar to those presented in Figures 17.1 and 17.2 are useful for comparisons of a variable’s importance in different models. Figure 17.3 presents single-permutation results for the random-forest, logistic-regression (see Section 5.2.1), and gradient-boosting (see Section 5.2.3) models. The best result, in terms of the smallest value of \\(L^0\\), is obtained for the random-forest model (as indicated by the location of the dashed lines in the plots). Note that the indicated \\(L^0\\) value for the model is different from the one indicated in Figure 17.1. This is due to the difference in the set of (random) permuations used to compute the two values. Figure 17.3: Single-permutation-based variable-importance measures for the random-forest, gradient-boosting, and logistic-regression models for the Titanic data with 1-AUC as the loss function. Note that the bars start at different places for different methods. This is due to the fact that the output AUC value calculated on the original data is highest for random forest and lowest for linear regression. For less important variables such as embarked we see that even after its permutation the quality of the random forest model is better than the output of the additive linear regression models. The plots in Figure 17.3 indicate that gender is the most important explanatory variable in all three models, followed by class and age. Variable fare, which is highly correlated with class, is important in the random-forest and SVM models, but not in the logistic-regression model. On the other hand, variable parch is, essentially, not important neither in the gradient-boosting nor in the logistic-regression model, but it has some importance in the random-forest model. Country is not important in any of the models. Overall, Figure 17.3 indicates that, in the random-forest model, all variables (except of country) have got some importance, while in the other two models the effect is mainly limited to gender, class, and age (and fare for the gradient-boosting model). 17.5 Pros and cons Permutation-based variable importance offers several advantages. It is a model-agnostic approach to assessment of the influence of an explanatory variable on a model’s performance. The plots of variable-importance measures are easy to understand, as they are compact and present the most important variables in a single graph. The measures can be compared between models and may lead to interesting insights. For example, if variables are correlated, then models like random forest are expected to spread importance across many variables, while in regularized-regression models the effect of one variable may dominate the effect of other correlated variables. The same approach can be used to measure importance of a single explanatory variable or a group of variables. The latter is useful for “aspects,” i.e., groups of variables that are complementary to each other or are related to a similar concept. For example, in the Titanic example, the fare and class variables are related to the financial status of a passenger. Instead of assessing the importance of each of these variables seprately, we may be interested in their joint importance. Toward this aim, we may compute the permutation-based measure by permuting the values of both variables at the same time. The main disadvantage of the permutation-based variable-importance measure is its dependence on the random nature of the permutations. As a result, for different permutations we will, in general, get different results. Also, the value of the measure depends on the choice of the loss function \\(\\mathcal L()\\). Thus, there is no single, “absolute” measure. 17.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present variable importance metrics as implemented in the DALEX package for R. The package covers the most often used measures and methods presented in this chapter. In particular, it includes function model_parts() that allows computation of the permutation-based variable-importance measures. For the purposes of the computation, one can choose among several loss fuctions that include loss_sum_of_squares(), loss_root_mean_square(), loss_accuracy(), loss_cross_entropy(), and loss_one_minus_auc(). For the definitions of the loss functions, see Chapter 16. For illustration purposes, we use the random-forest model apartments_rf for the apartment-prices data (see Section 5.5.2). We first load the model-object via the archivist hook, as listed in Section 5.5.6. We also load the randomForest package, as the model was fitted by using function randomForest() from this package (see Section 5.5.2) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). Note that we use the apartments_test data frame without the first column, i.e., the m2.price variable, in the data argument. This will be the dataset to which the model will be applied (see Section 5.5.5). The m2.price variable is explicitly specified as the dependent variable in the y argument. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) apartments_rf &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/fe7a5&quot;) explainer_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = apartments_rf, data = apartments_test[,-1], y = apartments_test$m2.price, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;, verbose = FALSE) A popular loss function is the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) function (16.2). It is implemented in the DALEX package as the loss_root_mean_square() function. The latter requires two arguments: observed, which indicates the vector of observed values of the dependent variable, and predicted, which specifies the object (either vector or a matrix, as returned from the model-specific predict() function) with the predicted values. The original-testing-data value \\(L^0\\) of RMSE for the random-forest model can be obtained by applying the loss_root_mean_square() in the form given below. loss_root_mean_square(observed = apartments_test$m2.price, predicted = predict(apartments_rf, apartments_test)) ## [1] 282.9519 To compute the permutation-based variable-importance measure, we apply the model_parts() function. Note that it is a wrapper for function feature_importance() from the ingredients package. The only required argument is explainer, which indicates the explainer-object (obtained with the help of the explain() function, see Section 5.2.6) for the model to be explained. The other arguments are: loss_function, the loss function to be used (by default, it is the loss_root_mean_square function); type, the form of the variable-importance measure, with values “raw” resulting in the computation of \\(\\mathcal L()\\), “difference” yielding \\(vip_{Diff}^j\\), and “ratio” providing \\(vip_{Ratio}^j\\) (see Section 17.3); variables, a character vector providing the names of the explanatory variables, for which the variable-importance measure is to be computed. By default, variables = NULL, in which case computations are performed for all variables in the dataset. variable_groups, a list of character vectors of names of explanatory variables. For each vector, a single variable-importance measure is computed for the joint effect of the variables which names are provided in the vector. By default, variable_groups = NULL, in which case variable-importance measures are computed separately for all variables indicated in the variables argument. B, the number of permuations to be used for the purpose of calculation of the (mean) variable-importance measures, with B = 10 used by default. To get a single-permutation-based measure, use B = 1. N, the number of observations that are to be sampled from the data available in the explainer-object for the purpose of calculation of the variable-importance measure; by default, N = 1000 is used; if N = NULL, the entire dataset is used. To compute a single-permutation-based value of the RMSE for all the explanatory variables included in the random-forest model apartments_rf, we apply the model_parts() function to the model’s explainer-object as shown below. We use the set.seed() function to make the process of random selection of the permutation repeateable. set.seed(1980) model_parts(explainer = explainer_rf, loss_function = loss_root_mean_square, B = 1) ## variable mean_dropout_loss label ## 1 _full_model_ 271.9089 Random Forest ## 2 construction.year 389.4840 Random Forest ## 3 no.rooms 396.0281 Random Forest ## 4 floor 436.6190 Random Forest ## 5 surface 462.7374 Random Forest ## 6 district 794.7619 Random Forest ## 7 _baseline_ 1095.4724 Random Forest Note that the outcome is identical to the following call below (results not shown). set.seed(1980) model_parts(explainer = explainer_rf, loss_function = loss_root_mean_square, B = 1, variables=colnames(explainer_rf$data)) However, if we use a different ordering of the variables in the variables argument, the result is slightly different: set.seed(1980) variabs &lt;- c(&quot;surface&quot;,&quot;floor&quot;,&quot;construction.year&quot;,&quot;no.rooms&quot;,&quot;district&quot; ) model_parts(explainer = explainer_rf, loss_function = loss_root_mean_square, B = 1, variables = variabs) ## variable mean_dropout_loss label ## 1 _full_model_ 271.9089 Random Forest ## 2 construction.year 393.1586 Random Forest ## 3 no.rooms 396.0281 Random Forest ## 4 floor 440.9293 Random Forest ## 5 surface 483.1104 Random Forest ## 6 district 794.7619 Random Forest ## 7 _baseline_ 1095.4724 Random Forest This is due to the fact that, despite the same seed, the first permutation is now selected for the surface variable, while in the previous code the same permutation was applied to the values of the floor variable. To compute the mean variable-importance measure based on 50 permutations and using the RMSE difference \\(vip_{Diff}^j\\) (see Section 17.3), we have got to specify the appropriate values of the B and type arguments. set.seed(1980) (vip.50 &lt;- model_parts(explainer = explainer_rf, loss_function = loss_root_mean_square, B = 50, type=&quot;difference&quot;)) ## variable mean_dropout_loss label ## 1 _full_model_ 0.0000 Random Forest ## 2 no.rooms 117.4678 Random Forest ## 3 construction.year 122.4445 Random Forest ## 4 floor 162.4554 Random Forest ## 5 surface 182.4368 Random Forest ## 6 district 563.7343 Random Forest ## 7 _baseline_ 843.0472 Random Forest To obain a graphical illustration, we apply the plot() function to the vip.50 object. library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) plot(vip.50) + ggtitle(&quot;Mean variable-importance over 50 permutations&quot;, &quot;&quot;) Figure 17.4: Mean variable-importance calculated using 50 permutations and the root-mean- squared-error loss for the random-forest model apartments_rf for the apartment-prices data. The resulting graph is presented in Figure 17.4. The bars in the plot indicate the mean values of the variable-importance measures for all explantory variables. Box plots are added to the bars to provide an idea about the distribution of the values of the measure across the permutations. Variable-importance measures are a very useful tool for model comparison. We will illustrate this application by considering the random-forest model, linear-regression model (Section 5.5.1), and support-vectore-machine (SVM) model (Section 5.5.3) for the appartment prices dataset. The models differ in their flexibility and structure; hence, it may be of interest to compare them. We first load the necessary model-objects via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.5.6. apartments_lm &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/55f19&quot;) apartments_svm &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/d2ca0&quot;) Then we construct the corresponding explainer-objects. We also load the e1071 package as it is important to have a suitable predict() function available for the SVM model. explainer_lm &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = apartments_lm, data = apartments_test[,-1], y = apartments_test$m2.price, label = &quot;Linear Regression&quot;, verbose = FALSE) library(&quot;e1071&quot;) explainer_svm &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = apartments_svm, data = apartments_test[,-1], y = apartments_test$m2.price, label = &quot;Support Vector Machine&quot;, verbose = FALSE) Subsequently, we compute mean values of the permutation-based variable-importance measure for 50 permuations and the RMSE loss function. Note that we use the set.seed() function to make the process of random selection of the permutation repeateable. By specifying N = NULL we include all the data from the apartments dataset in the calcuations. vip_lm &lt;- model_parts(explainer = explainer_lm, B = 50, N = NULL) vip_rf &lt;- model_parts(explainer = explainer_rf, B = 50, N = NULL) vip_svm &lt;- model_parts(explainer = explainer_svm, B = 50, N = NULL) Finally, we apply the plot() function to the created objects to obtain a single plot with the variable-importance measures for all three models. library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) plot(vip_rf, vip_svm, vip_lm, bar_width = 5) + ggtitle(&quot;Mean variable-importance over 50 permutations&quot;, &quot;&quot;) Figure 17.5: Mean variable-importance calculated using 50 permutations and the root-mean-squared-error loss for the random-forest, support-vector-machine, and linear-regression models for the apartment-prices data. The resulting graph is presented in Figure 17.5. The plots suggest that the best result, in terms of the smallest value of \\(L^0\\), is obtained for the SVM model (as indicated by the location of the dashed lines in the plots). The length of bars indicates that district is the most important explanatory variable in all three models, followed by surface and floor. Construction year is the fourth most important variable for the random-forest and SVM models, but it is not important in the linear-regression model at all. We will investigate the reason for this difference in the next chapter. 17.7 Code snippets for Python In this section, we use the dalex library for Python. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on pip and GitHub. For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.3.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. In the first step we create an Explainer, an object that will provide a uniform interface for the predictive model. We use the Explainer constructor for this purpose. import pandas as pd henry = pd.DataFrame({&#39;gender&#39;: [&#39;male&#39;], &#39;age&#39;: [47], &#39;class&#39;: [&#39;1st&#39;], &#39;embarked&#39;: [&#39;Southampton&#39;], &#39;fare&#39;: [25], &#39;sibsp&#39;: [0], &#39;parch&#39;: [0]}, index = [&#39;Henry&#39;]) import dalex as dx titanic_rf_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_rf, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic RF Pipeline&quot;) To calculate the model performance one can use the model_parts method. mp_rf = exp_rf.model_parts() mp_rf.result The resulting object can be visualised with the plot method. mp_rf.plot() The model_parts method has similar arguments as the corresponding R version. Among others, the user can set: loss_function e.g. rmse or 1-auc; type one of variable_importance, ratio, difference; variable_groups groups of variables that shall be tested together. For example, if we want to analyse importance of groups of variables, we can set these groups in a following manner. vi_grouped = exp_rf.model_parts(variable_groups={&#39;personal&#39;: [&#39;gender&#39;, &#39;age&#39;, &#39;sibsp&#39;, &#39;parch&#39;], &#39;wealth&#39;: [&#39;class&#39;, &#39;fare&#39;]}) vi_grouped.result References "],

They were introduced in the context of gradient-boosting machines (GBM) by Friedman (2000). For many years, PD profiles went unnoticed in the shadow of GBM. However, in recent years, they have become very popular and are available in many data-science-oriented packages like DALEX (Biecek 2018), iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018), pdp (Greenwell 2017) or PDPbox (Jiangchun 2018). The general idea underlying the construction of PD profiles is to show how does the expected value of model prediction behave as a function of a selected explanatory variable? For a single model, one can construct an overall PD profile by using all observations from a dataset, or several profiles for sub-groups of the observations. Comparison of sub-group-specific profiles may provide important insight into, for instance, stability of the model’s predictions. PD profiles are also useful for comparisons of different models: Agreement between profiles for different models is reassuring. Some models are more flexible than others. If PD profiles for models, which differ with respect to flexibility, are similar, we can treat it as a evidence that the more flexible model is not over-fitting, and both models learned the same relation. Disagreement between profiles may suggest a way to improve a model. If a PD profile of a simpler, more interpretable model disagrees with a profile of a flexible model, this may suggest a variable transformation that can be used to improve the interpretable model. For example, if a random-forest model indicates a non-linear relationship between the dependent variable and an explanatory variable, then a suitable transformation of the explanatory variable may improve the fit or performance of a linear-regression model. Evaluation of model performance at boundaries. Models are known to have a different behavior at the boundaries of the possible range of a dependent variable, i.e., for the largest or the lowest values. For instance, random-forest models are known to shrink predictions towards the average, whereas support-vector machines are known for a larger variance at edges. Comparison of PD profiles may help to understand the differences in models’ behavior at boundaries. 18.2 Intuition To show how does the expected value of model prediction behave as a function of a selected explanatory variable, the average of a set of individual ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles is used. Recall that a CP profile (see Chapter 11) shows the dependence of an instance-level prediction on an explanatory variable. A PD profile is estimated by the mean of the CP profiles for all instances (observations) from a dataset. Note that, for additive models, CP profiles are parallel. In particular, they have got the same shape. Consequently, the mean retains the shape, while offering a more precise estimate. However, for models that, for instance, include interactions, CP profiles may not be parallel. In that case, the mean may not necessarily correspond to the shape of any particular profile. Nevertheless, it can still offer a summary of how (in general) the model’s predictions depend on changes in a given explanatory variable. The left-hand-side panel of Figure 18.1 presents CP profiles for the explanatory variable age in the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) for 25 randomly selected instances (observations) from the Titanic dataset (see Section 5.1). Note that the profiles are not parallel, indicating non-additive effects of explanatory variables. The right-hand-side panel shows the mean of the CP profiles, which offers an estimate of the PD profile. Clearly, the shape of the PD profile does not capture, for instance, the shape of the group of five CP profiles shown at the top of the panel. Nevertheless, it does seem to reflect the fact that the majority of CP profiles suggest a substantial drop in the predicted probability of survival for the ages between 2 and 18. Figure 18.1: Ceteris-paribus (CP) and partial-dependence (PD) profiles for the random-forest model for 25 randomly selected observations from the Titanic dataset. Left-hand-side plot: CP profiles for age; blue dots indicate the age and corresponding prediction for the selected observations. Right-hand-side plot: CP profiles (grey lines) and the corresponding PD profile (blue line). 18.3 Method 18.3.1 Partial-dependence profiles The value of a PD profile for model \\(f()\\) and explanatory variable \\(X^j\\) at \\(z\\) is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} g_{PD}^{j}(z) = E_{\\underline{X}^{-j}}[f(X^{j|=z})]. \\tag{18.1} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, it is the expected value of the model predictions when \\(X^j\\) is fixed at \\(z\\) over the (marginal) distribution of \\(\\underline{X}^{-j}\\), i.e., over the joint distribution of all explanatory variables other than \\(X^j\\). Or, in other words, it is the expected value of the CP profile for \\(X^j\\), defined in (11.1), over the distribution of \\(\\underline{X}^{-j}\\). Usually, we do not know the true distribution of \\(\\underline{X}^{-j}\\). We can estimate it, however, by the empirical distribution of \\(n\\), say, observations available in a training dataset. This leads to the use of the mean of CP profiles for \\(X^j\\) as an estimator of the PD profile: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat g_{PD}^{j}(z) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(\\underline{x}_i^{j|=z}). \\tag{18.2} \\end{equation}\\] 18.3.2 Clustered partial-dependence profiles As it has been already mentioned, the mean of CP profiles is a good summary if the profiles are parallel. If they are not parallel, the average may not adequately represent the shape of a subset of profiles. To deal with this issue, one can consider clustering the profiles and calculating the mean separately for each cluster. To cluster the CP profiles, one may use standard methods like K-means or hierarchical clustering. The similarities between observations can be calculated based on the Euclidean distance between CP profiles. Figure 18.2 illustrates an application of that approach to the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) for 100 randomly selected instances (observations) from the Titanic dataset. The CP profiles for the age variable are marked in grey. It can be noted that they could be split into three clusters: one for a group of passengers with a substantial drop in the predicted survival probability for ages below 18 (with the average represented by the blue line), one with an almost linear decrease of the probability over the age (with the average represented by the red line), and one with almost constant predicted probability (with the average represented by the green line). The plot itself does not allow to identify the variables that may be linked with these clusters, but additional exploratory analysis could be performed for this purpose. Figure 18.2: Clustered partial-dependence profiles for age for the random-forest model for 100 randomly selected observations from the Titanic dataset. Grey lines indicate ceteris-paribus profiles that are clustered into three groups with the average profiles indicated by the blue, green, and red lines. 18.3.3 Grouped partial-dependence profiles It may happen that we can identify an explanatory variable that influences the shape of CP profiles for the explanatory variable of interest. The most obvious situation is when a model includes an interaction between the variable and another one. In that case, a natural approach is to investigate the PD profiles for the variable of interest within the groups of observations defined by the variable involved in the interaction. Figure 18.3 illustrates an application of the approach to the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) for 100 randomly selected instances (observations) from the Titanic dataset. The CP profiles for the explanatory-variable age are marked in grey. The red and blue lines present the PD profiles for females and males, respectively. The latter have different shapes: the predicted survival probability for females is more stable across different ages, as compared to males. Thus, the PD profiles clearly indicate an interaction between age and gender. Figure 18.3: Partial-dependence profiles for two genders for the random-forest model for 100 randomly selected observations from the Titanic dataset. Grey lines indicate ceteris-paribus profiles for age. 18.3.4 Contrastive partial-dependence profiles Comparison of clustered or grouped PD profiles for a single model may provide important insight into, for instance, stability of the model predictions. PD profiles can also be compared between different models. Figure 18.4 presents PD profiles for age for the random-forest model and the logistic-regression model with splines for the Titanic data (see Section 5.2.2). The profiles are similar with respect to a general relationship between age and the predicted probability of survival (the younger the passenger, the better chance of survival). However, the profile for the random-forest model is flatter. The difference between both models is the largest at the left edge of the age scale. This pattern can be seen as expected, because random-forest models, in general, shrink predictions towards the average and they are not very good for extrapolation outside the range of values observed in the training dataset. Figure 18.4: Partial-dependence profiles for age for the random-forest (green line) and logistic-regression (blue line) models for the Titanic dataset. 18.4 Example: apartment-prices data In this section, we use PD profiles to evaluate performance of the random-forest model (see Section 5.5.2) for the apartment-prices dataset (see Section 5.4). Recall that the goal is to predict the price per square meter of an apartment. In our illustration, we focus on two explanatory variables, surface and construction year. We consider the predictions for the training dataset apartments. 18.4.1 Partial-dependence profiles Figure 18.5 presents CP profiles (grey lines) for 100 randomly-selected apartments together with the estimated PD profile (blue line) for construction year and surface. PD profile for surface suggests an approximately linear relationship between the explanatory variable and the predicted price. On the other hand, PD profile for construction year is U-shaped: the predicted price is the highest for the very new and very old apartments. Note that, while the data were simulated, they were generated to reflect the effect of a lower quality of building materials used in rapid housing construction after the World War II. Figure 18.5: Ceteris-paribus and partial-dependence profiles for construction year and surface for 100 randomly-selected apartments for the random-forest model for the apartment-prices dataset. 18.4.2 Clustered partial-dependence profiles Almost all CP profiles for construction year, presented in Figure 18.5, seem to be U-shaped. The same shape is observed for the PD profile. One might want to confirm that the shape is, indeed, common for all the observations. The left-hand-side panel of Figure 18.6 presents clustered PD profiles for construction year for three clusters derived from the CP profiles presented in Figure 18.5. The three PD profiles differ slightly in the size of the oscillations at the edges, but they all are U-shaped. Thus, we could conclude that the overall PD profile adequately captures the shape of the CP profiles. Or, put differently, there is little evidence that there might be any strong interaction between year of construction and any other variable in the model. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the CP and PD profiles for surface, presented in the right-hand-side panel of Figure 18.6. Figure 18.6: Ceteris-paribus (grey lines) and partial-dependence profiles (red, green, and blue lines) for three clusters for 100 randomly-selected apartments for the random-forest model for the apartment-prices dataset. Left-hand-side panel: profiles for construction year. Right-hand-side panel: profiles for surface. 18.4.3 Grouped partial-dependence profiles One of the categorical explanatory variables in the apartment prices dataset is district. We may want to investigate whether the relationship between the model predictions and construction year and surface is similar for all districts. Toward this aim, we can use grouped PD profiles, for groups of apartments defined by districts. Figure 18.7 shows PD profiles for construction year (left-hand-side panel) and surface (right-hand-side panel) for each district. Several observations are worth making. First, profiles for apartments in “Srodmiescie” (Downtown) are clearly much higher than for other districts. Second, the profiles are roughly parallel, indicating that the effects of construction year and surface are similar for each level of district. Third, the profiles appear to form three clusters, i.e., “Srodmiescie” (Downtown), three districts close to “Srodmiescie” (namely “Mokotow,” “Ochota,” and “Ursynow”), and the six remaining districts. Figure 18.7: Partial-dependence profiles for separate districts for the random-forest model for the apartment-prices dataset. Left-hand-side panel: profiles for construction year. Right-hand-side panel: profiles for surface. 18.4.4 Contrastive partial-dependence profiles One of the main challenges in predictive modelling is to avoid over-fitting. The issue is particularly important for flexible models, such as random-forest models. Figure 18.8 presents PD profiles for construction year (left-hand-side panel) and surface (right-hand-side panel) for the linear-regression model (see Section 5.5.1) and the random-forest model. Several observations are worth making. The linear-regression model cannot, of course, accommodate the non-monotonic relationship between construction year and the price per square meter. However, for surface, both models support a linear relationship, though the slope of the line resulting from the linear regression is steeper. This may be seen as an expected difference, given that random-forest models yield predictions that are shrunk towards the mean. Overall, we could cautiously conclude that there is not much evidence for overfitting of the more flexible random-forest model. Note that the non-monotonic relationship between construction year and the price per square meter might be the reason why the explantory variable was found in Section 17.6 not to be important in the model. In Section 5.5.4, we mentioned that a proper model exploration may suggest a way to construct a model with an improved performance, as compared to the random-forest and linear-regression models. In this respect, it is worth observing that the profiles in Figure 18.8 suggest that both models miss some aspects of the data. In particular, the linear-regression model does not capture the U-shaped relationship between construction year and the price. On the other hand, the effect of surface on the apartment price seems to be underestimated by the random-forest model. Hence, one could conclude that, by addressing the issues, one could improve either of the models, possibly with an improvement in predictive performance. Figure 18.8: Partial-dependence profiles for the linear-regression and random-forest models for the apartment-prices dataset. Left-hand-side panel: profiles for construction year. Right-hand-side panel: profiles for surface. 18.5 Pros and cons PD profiles, presented in this chapter, offer a simple way to summarize the effect of a particular explanatory variable on the dependent variable. They are easy to explain and intuitive. They can be obtained for sub-groups of observations and compared across different models. For these reasons, they have gained in popularity and have been implemented in various software packages, including R and Python. Given that the PD profiles are averages of CP profiles, they inherit the limitations of the latter. In particular, as CP profiles are problematic for correlated explanatory variables (see Section 11.5), PD profiles are also not suitable for that case, as they may offer a crude and potentially misleading summarization. An approach to deal with this issue will be discussed in the next chapter. 18.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present variable importance metrics as implemented in the DALEX package for R. The package covers the most often used measures and methods presented in this chapter. Similar functions can be found in packages pdp (Greenwell 2017), ALEPlots (Apley 2018), and iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018). For illustration purposes, we use the random-forest model titanic_rf (see Section 5.2.2) for the Titanic data. Recall that the model has been developed to predict the probability of survival from sinking of Titanic. We first retrieve the version of the titanic data with imputed missing values and the titanic_rf model-object via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.2.7. Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). Note that, beforehand, we have got to load the randomForest package, as the model was fitted by using function randomForest() from this package (see Section 5.2.2) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) titanic_imputed &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/27e5c&quot;) model_rf &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/4e0fc&quot;) explainer_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = model_rf, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;, verbose = FALSE) 18.6.1 Partial-dependence profiles The function that allows computation of PD profiles in the DALEX package is model_profile(). The only required argument is explainer, which indicates the explainer-object (obtained with the help of the explain() function, see Section 5.2.6) for the model to be explained. The other useful arguments include: variables, a character vector providing the names of the explanatory variables, for which the profile is to be computed; by default, variables = NULL, in which case computations are performed for all variables included in the model. N, the number of (randomly sampled) observations that are to be used for the calculation of the PD profiles (N = 100 by default); N = NULL implies the use of the entire dataset included in the explainer-object. type, the type of the PD profile, with values “partial” (default), “conditional,” and “accumulated”; this argument will be groups, the name of the explanatory variable that will be used to group profiles, with groups = NULL by default (in which case no grouping of profiles is applied); k, the number of clusters to be created with the help of the hclust() function, with k = NULL used by default and implying no clustering. In the example below, we calculate the PD profile for age by applying the model_profile() function to the explainer-object for the random-forest model. By default, the profile is based on 100 randomly selected observations. pdp_rf &lt;- model_profile(explainer = explainer_rf, variables = &quot;age&quot;) The resulting object of class model_profile contains the PD profile for age. By applying the plot() function to the object, we obtain a plot of the PD profile. Had we not used the variables argument, we would have obtained separate plots of PD profiles for all continuous explanatory variables. library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) plot(pdp_rf) + ggtitle(&quot;Partial-dependence profile for age&quot;) The resulting plot for age (not shown) corresponds to the one shown for in Figure 18.4. It may slightly differ, as the two plots are based on different sets of (randomly selected) 100 observations from the Titanic dataset. A PD profile can be plotted on top of CP profiles. This is a very useful feature if we want to check how well the former captures the latter. It is worth noting that, apart from the PD profile, the object created by the model_profile() function also contains the CP profiles for the selected observations and all explanatory variables included in the model. By specifying argument geom = \"profiles\" in the plot() function, we add the CP profiles to the plot of the PD profile. plot(pdp_rf, geom = &quot;profiles&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris-paribus and partial-dependence profiles for age&quot;) The resulting plot (not shown) is essentially the same as the one shown in the right-hand-side panel of Figure 18.1. 18.6.2 Clustered partial-dependence profiles To calculate clustered PD profiles, we have got to cluster the CP profiles. Toward this aim, we use the k argument of the model_profile function that specifies the number of clusters that are to be formed by the hclust() function. In the code below, we specify that three clusters are to be formed for profiles for age. pdp_rf_clust &lt;- model_profile(explainer = explainer_rf, variables = &quot;age&quot;, k = 3) The clustered PD profiles can be plotted on top of the CP profiles by using the geom = \"profiles\" argument in the plot() function. plot(pdp_rf_clust, geom = &quot;profiles&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Clustered partial-dependence profiles for age&quot;) The resulting plot (not shown) resembles the one shown for the random-forest model in Figure 18.2. The only difference may stem from the fact that the two plots are based on a different set of (randomly selected) 100 observations from the Titanic dataset. 18.6.3 Grouped partial-dependence profiles The model_profile() function admits the groups argument that allows constructing PD profiles for groups of observations defined by the levels of an explanatory variable. In the example below, we use the argument to obtain PD profiles for age, while grouping them by gender. pdp_rf_gender &lt;- model_profile(explainer = explainer_rf, variables = &quot;age&quot;, groups = &quot;gender&quot;) The grouped PD profiles can be plotted on top of the CP profiles by using the geom = \"profiles\" argument in the plot() function. plot(pdp_rf_gender, geom = &quot;profiles&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Partial-dependence profiles for age, grouped by gender&quot;) The resulting plot (not shown) resembles the one shown in Figure 18.3. 18.6.4 Contrastive partial-dependence profiles It may be of interest to compare PD profiles for several models. We will compare the random-forest model with the linear-regression model titanic_lmr (see Section 5.2.1). For the latter, we first have got to load it via the archivist hook, as listed in Section 5.5.6. Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain(). Note that we first load the rms package, as the model was fitted by using function lmr() from this package (see Section 5.2.1) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. Finally, we apply the model_profile() function to compute CP profiles and the PD profile for age based on 100 randomly-selected observations from the Titanic dataset. We also repeat the calculations of the profiles for the random-forest model. library(&quot;rms&quot;) model_lmr &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/58b24&quot;) explainer_lmr &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = model_lmr, data = titanic_imputed[, -9], y = titanic_imputed$survived, label = &quot;Logistic Regression&quot;, verbose = FALSE) pdp_lmr &lt;- model_profile(explainer = explainer_lmr, variables = &quot;age&quot;) pdp_rf &lt;- model_profile(explainer = explainer_rf, variables = &quot;age&quot;) To overlay the PD profiles for age for the two models in a single plot, we apply the plot() function to the agr_profiles components of the “model_profile”-class objects for the two models. The components contain the PD profiles for age. plot(pdp_rf$agr_profiles, pdp_lmr$agr_profiles) + ggtitle(&quot;Partial-dependence profiles for age for two models&quot;) As a result, the profiles are plotted in a single plot. The resulting graph (not shown) is essentially the same as the one presented in Figure 18.4, with a possible difference due to the use of a different set of (randomly selected) 100 observations from the Titanic dataset. 18.7 Code snippets for Python In this section, we use the dalex library for Python. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on pip and GitHub. The package covers the most often used measures and methods presented in this chapter. Similar functions can be found in library PDPbox (Jiangchun 2018). For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf random forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 5.3.2. Recall that the model is developed to predict the probability of survival for passengers of Titanic. In the first step we create an Explainer, an object that will provide a uniform interface for the predictive model. We use the Explainer constructor for this purpose. import pandas as pd henry = pd.DataFrame({&#39;gender&#39;: [&#39;male&#39;], &#39;age&#39;: [47], &#39;class&#39;: [&#39;1st&#39;], &#39;embarked&#39;: [&#39;Southampton&#39;], &#39;fare&#39;: [25], &#39;sibsp&#39;: [0], &#39;parch&#39;: [0]}, index = [&#39;Henry&#39;]) import dalex as dx titanic_rf_exp = dx.Explainer(titanic_rf, X, y, label = &quot;Titanic RF Pipeline&quot;) The function that allows calculations of PD profiles is model_profile(). By defaut, it calculates profiles for all continuous variables. The other useful arguments include: variables, a character vector providing the names of the explanatory variables, for which the profile is to be computed; by default computations are performed for all variables included in the model. N, the number of (randomly sampled) observations that are to be used for the calculation of the PD profiles (N = 100 by default); N = None implies the use of the entire dataset included in the explainer-object. type, the type of the PD profile, with values “partial” (default), “conditional,” and “accumulated”; groups, the name of the explanatory variable that will be used to group profiles, with groups = None by default (in which case no grouping of profiles is applied); In the example below, we calculate the PD profile for age by applying the model_profile() function to the explainer-object for the random-forest model. By default, the profile is based on 100 randomly selected observations. mp_rf = exp_rf.model_profile() mp_rf.result The resulting object can be visualised with the plot method. mp_rf.plot() A PD profile can be plotted on top of CP profiles. This is a very useful feature if we want to check how well the former captures the latter. By specifying the argument geom = \"profiles\" in the plot() function, we add the CP profiles to the plot of the PD profile. mp_rf.plot(geom=&#39;profiles&#39;) The resulting plot (not shown) is essentially the same as the one shown in the right-hand-side panel of Figure 18.1. By default, the model_profile function draws profiles only for continuous variables. To draw these profiles for categorical variables, add the argument variable_type='categorical'. The following example calculates and plots profiles for class and gender/ mp_rf = exp_rf.model_profile( variable_type=&#39;categorical&#39;) mp_rf.plot(variables = [&#39;gender&#39;, &#39;class&#39;]) 18.7.1 Grouped partial-dependence profiles The model_profile() function admits the groups argument that allows constructing PD profiles for groups of observations defined by the levels of an explanatory variable. In the example below, we use the argument to obtain PD profiles for age, while grouping them by gender. mp_rf = exp_rf.model_profile(groups = &#39;gender&#39;, variables = [&#39;age&#39;, &#39;fare&#39;]) mp_rf.plot() 18.7.2 Contrastive partial-dependence profiles It may be of interest to compare PD profiles for several models. We will compare the random-forest model with the logistic-regression model titanic_lr. pdp_rf = exp_rf.model_profile() pdp_lr = exp_lr.model_profile() pdp_rf.plot(pdp_lr, variables = [&#39;age&#39;, &#39;fare&#39;]) As a result, the profiles are plotted in a single plot. The resulting graph (not shown) is essentially the same as the one presented in Figure 18.4. References "],

However, as it was mentioned in Section 18.5, the profiles may be misleading if, for instance, explanatory variables are correlated. In many applications, this is the case. For example, in the apartment-prices dataset (see Section 5.4), one can expect that variables surface and number of rooms may be positively correlated, because apartments with larger number of rooms usually also have a larger surface. Thus, it is not realistic to consider, for instance, an apartment with five rooms and surface of 20 square meters. Similarly, in the Titanic dataset, a positive association can be expected for the values of variables fare and class, as tickets in the higher classes are more expensive than in the lower classes. In this chapter, we present accumulated local profiles that address this issue. As they are related to local-dependence profiles, we introduce the latter first. Both approaches were proposed by Apley (2018). 19.2 Intuition Let us consider the following simple linear model with two explanatory variables: \\[\\begin{equation} Y = X^1 + X^2 + \\varepsilon = f(X^1, X^2) + \\varepsilon, \\tag{19.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\varepsilon \\sim N(0,0.1^2)\\). For this model, the effect of \\(X^1\\) for any value of \\(X^2\\) is linear, i.e., it can be described by a straight line with the intercept equal to 0 and the slope equal to 1. Assume that observations of explanatory variables \\(X^1\\) ad \\(X^2\\) are uniformly distributed over the unit square, as illustrated in the left-hand-side panel of Figure 19.1 for a set of 1000 observations. The right-hand-side panel of Figure 19.1 presents the scatter plot of the observed values of \\(Y\\) in function of \\(X^1\\). The plot for \\(X^2\\) is, essentially, the same and we do not show it. Figure 19.1: Observations of two explanatory variables uniformly distributed over the unit square (left-hand-side panel) and the scatter plot of the observed values of the dependent variable \\(Y\\) in function of \\(X^1\\) (right-hand-side panel). In view of the plot shown in the right-hand-side panel of Figure 19.1, we could consider using a simple linear model with \\(X^1\\) and \\(X^2\\) as explanatory variables. Assume, however, that we would like to analyze the data without postulating any particular parametric form of the effect of the variables. A naïve way would be to split the observed range of each of the two variables into, for instance, five intervals (as illustrated in the left-hand-side panel of Figure 19.1), and estimate the means of observed values of \\(Y\\) for the resulting 25 groups of observations. The table below provides the sample means (with rows and columns defined by the ranges of possible values of, respectively, \\(X^1\\) and \\(X^2\\)). ## (0,0.2] (0.2,0.4] (0.4,0.6] (0.6,0.8] (0.8,1] ## (0,0.2] 0.19 0.42 0.63 0.80 0.99 ## (0.2,0.4] 0.39 0.59 0.81 1.01 1.19 ## (0.4,0.6] 0.59 0.81 0.98 1.20 1.44 ## (0.6,0.8] 0.76 1.00 1.20 1.40 1.58 ## (0.8,1] 1.01 1.22 1.38 1.58 1.77 The means are based on the following numbers of observations: ## (0,0.2] (0.2,0.4] (0.4,0.6] (0.6,0.8] (0.8,1] total ## (0,0.2] 51 39 31 43 43 207 ## (0.2,0.4] 39 40 35 53 42 209 ## (0.4,0.6] 28 42 35 49 40 194 ## (0.6,0.8] 37 30 36 55 45 203 ## (0.8,1] 43 46 36 28 34 187 ## total 198 197 173 228 204 1000 By using this simple approach, we can compute the PD profile for \\(X^1\\). Consider \\(X^1=z\\). To apply the estimator defined in (18.2), we need the predicted values \\(\\hat{f}(z,x^2_i)\\) for any observed value of \\(x^2_i \\in [0,1]\\). As our observations are uncorrelated and fill-in the unit-square, we can use the suitable mean values for that purpose. In particular, for \\(z \\in [0,0.2]\\), we get \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\hat g_{PD}^{1}(z) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{1000}\\sum_{i}\\hat{f}(z,x^2_i) = \\\\ &amp;=&amp; (198\\times 0.19+197\\times 0.42+ 173\\times 0.63 + 228\\times 0.80 + 204\\times 1.00)/1000 = \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.6. \\tag{19.2} \\end{eqnarray}\\] By following the same principle, for \\(z \\in (0.2,0.4]\\), \\((0.4,0.6]\\), \\((0.6,0.8]\\), and \\((0.8,1]\\) we get the values of 0.8, 1, 1.2, and 1.4. Thus, overall, we obtain a piecewise-constant profile with values that capture the (correct) linear effect of \\(X^1\\) in model (19.1). In fact, by using, for instance, midpoints of the intervals for \\(z\\), i.e., 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9, we could describe the profile by the linear function \\(0.5+z\\). Assume now that we are given the data only from the regions on the diagonal of the unit square, as illustrated in the left-hand-side panel of Figure 19.2. In that case, the observed values of \\(X^1\\) and \\(X^2\\) are strongly correlated, with the estimated value of Pearson’s correlation coefficient equal to 0.96. The right-hand-side panel of Figure 19.2 presents the scatter plot of the observed values of \\(Y\\) in function of \\(X^1\\). Figure 19.2: Correlated observations of two explanatory variables (left-hand-side panel) and the scatter plot of the observed values of the dependent variable \\(Y\\) in function of \\(X^1\\) (right-hand-side panel). Now, the “naïve” modelling approach would amount to using only five sample means, as in the table below. ## (0,0.2] (0.2,0.4] (0.4,0.6] (0.6,0.8] (0.8,1] ## (0,0.2] 0.19 NA NA NA NA ## (0.2,0.4] NA 0.59 NA NA NA ## (0.4,0.6] NA NA 0.98 NA NA ## (0.6,0.8] NA NA NA 1.4 NA ## (0.8,1] NA NA NA NA 1.77 When computing the PD profile for \\(X^1\\), we now encounter the issue related to the fact that, for instance, for \\(z \\in [0,0.2]\\), we have not got any observations and, hence, any sample mean for \\(x^2_i&gt;0.2\\). To overcome this issue, we could extrapolate the predictions (i.e., mean values) obtained for other intervals of \\(z\\). That is, we could assume that, for \\(x^2_i \\in (0.2,0.4]\\), the prediction is equal to 0.59, for \\(x^2_i \\in (0.4,0.6]\\) it is equal to 0.98, and so on. This leads to the following value of the PD profile for \\(z \\in [0,0.2]\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\hat g_{PD}^{1}(z) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{207}\\sum_{i}\\hat{f}(z,x^2_i) = \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{1000}(198\\times 0.19+197\\times 0.59+ 173\\times 0.99 + 228\\times 1.40 + 204\\times 1.77)=1. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] This is a larger value than 0.6 computed in (19.2) for the uncorrelated data. The reason is the extrapolation: for instance, for \\(z \\in [0,0.2]\\) and \\(x^2_i \\in (0.6,0.8]\\), we use 1.40 as the predicted value of \\(Y\\). However, we have seen that the sample mean for those observations is equal to 0.80. In fact, by using the same extrapolation principle, we get \\(\\hat g_{PD}^{1}(z) = 1\\) also for \\(z \\in (0.2,0.4]\\), \\((0.4,0.6]\\), \\((0.6,0.8]\\), and \\((0.8,1]\\). Thus, the obtained profile indicates no effect of \\(X^1\\), which clearly a wrong conclusion. While the modeling approach presented in the example above may seem to be simplistic, it does illustrate the issue that would also appear for other flexible modeling methods like, for instance, regression trees. In particular, the left-hand-side panel of Figure 19.3 presents a regression tree fitted to the data shown in Figure 19.2 by using function tree() from the R package tree. The right-hand-side panel of Figure 19.3 presents the corresponding split of the observations. According to the model, the predicted value of \\(Y\\) for the observations in the region \\(x^1 \\in [0,0.2]\\) and \\(x^2 \\in [0.8,1]\\) would be equal to 1.74. This extrapolation implies a substantial overestimation, as the true expected value of \\(Y\\) in the region is equal to 1. Note that the latter is well estimated by the sample mean equal to 0.99 in the case of the uncorrelated data shown in Figure 19.1. The PD profile for \\(X^1\\) for the regression tree would be equal to 0.2, 0.8, and 1.5 for \\(z \\in [0,0.2]\\), \\((0.2,0.6]\\), and \\((0.6,1]\\), respectively. It does show an effect of \\(X^1\\), but the obtained values deviate from linearity. For instance, by using midpoints of the intervals for \\(z\\), i.e., 0.1, 0.4, and 0.8 we could (approximately) describe the profile by the linear function \\(2z\\), i.e., with a slope larger than 1. Figure 19.3: Results of fitting of a regression tree to the data shown in Figure 19.2 (left-hand-side panel) and the corresponding split of the observations of the two explanatory variables (right-hand-side panel). The issue stems from the fact that, in the definition (18.1) of the PD profile, the expected value of model predictions is computed by using the marginal distribution of \\(X^2\\), which disregards the value of \\(X^1\\). Clearly, this is an issue when the explanatory variables are correlated. This observation suggests a modification: instead of the marginal distribution, one might use the conditional distribution of \\(X^2\\) given \\(X^1\\), because it reflects the association between the two variables. The modification leads to the definition of an LD profile. It turns out, however, that the modification does not fully address the issue of correlated explanatory variables. As argued by Apley and Zhu (2019), if an explanatory variable is correlated with some other variables, the LD profile for the variable will still capture the effect of the other variables. This is because the profile is obtained by marginalizing over (in fact, ignoring) the remaining variables in the model, which results in an effect similar to the “ommittted variable” bias in linear regression. Thus, in this respect, LD profiles share the same limitation as PD profiles. To address the limitation, Apley and Zhu (2019) proposed the concept of accumulated local effects and accumulated local (AL) profiles. 19.3 Method 19.3.1 Local-dependence profile LD profile for model \\(f()\\) and variable \\(X^j\\) is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} g_{LD}^{f, j}(z) = E_{\\underline{X}^{-j}|X^j=z}\\left\\{f\\left(\\underline{X}^{j|=z}\\right)\\right\\}. \\tag{19.3} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, it is the expected value of the model predictions over the conditional distribution of \\(\\underline{X}^{-j}\\) given \\(X^j=z\\), i.e., over the joint distribution of all explanatory variables other than \\(X^j\\) conditional on the value of the latter variable set to \\(z\\). Or, in other words, it is the expected value of the CP profiles for \\(X^j\\), defined in (11.1), over the conditional distribution of \\(\\underline{X}^{-j} | X^j = z\\). As proposed by Apley and Zhu (2019), LD profile can be estimated as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat g_{LD}^{f,j}(z) = \\frac{1}{|N_j|} \\sum_{k\\in N_j} f\\left(\\underline{x}_k^{j| = z}\\right), \\tag{19.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(N_j\\) is the set of observations with the value of \\(X^j\\) “close” to \\(z\\) that is used to estimate the conditional distribution of \\(\\underline{X}^{-j}|X^j=z\\). Note that, in general, the estimator given in (19.4) is neither smooth nor continuous at boundaries between subsets \\(N_j\\). A smooth estimator for \\(g_{LD}^{f,j}(z)\\) can be defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tilde g_{LD}^{f,j}(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sum_k w_{k}(z)} \\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i(z) f\\left(\\underline{x}_i^{j| = z}\\right), \\tag{19.5} \\end{equation}\\] where weights \\(w_i(z)\\) capture the distance between \\(z\\) and \\(x_i^j\\). In particular, for a categorical variable, we may just use the indicator function \\(w_i(z) = 1_{z = x^j_i}\\), while for a continuous variable we may use the Gaussian kernel: \\[\\begin{equation} w_i(z) = \\phi(z - x_i^j, 0, s), \\tag{19.6} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\phi(y,0,s)\\) is the density of a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation \\(s\\). Note that \\(s\\) plays the role of a smoothing factor. As already mentioned in Section 19.2, if an explanatory variable is correlated with some other variables, the LD profile for the variable will capture the effect of all of the variables. For instance, consider model (19.1). Assume that \\(X^1\\) has a uniform distribution on \\([0,1]\\) and that \\(X^1=X^2\\), i.e., the two explanatory variables are perfectly correlated. In that case, the LD profile for \\(X^1\\) is given by \\[ g_{LD}^{1}(z) = E_{X^2|X^1=z}(z+X^2) = z + E_{X^2|X^1=z}(X^2) = 2z. \\] Hence, it suggests an effect of \\(X^1\\) twice larger than the correct one. To address the limitation, AL profiles can be used. We present them in the next section. 19.3.2 Accumulated local profile Consider model \\(f()\\) and define \\[ q^j(\\underline{u})=\\left\\{ \\frac{\\partial f(\\underline{x})}{\\partial x^j} \\right\\}_{\\underline{x}=\\underline{u}}. \\] The AL profile for model \\(f()\\) and variable \\(X^j\\) is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} g_{AL}^{f, j}(z) = \\int_{z_0}^z \\left[E_{\\underline{X}^{-j}|X^j=v}\\left\\{ q^j(\\underline{X}^{j|=v}) \\right\\}\\right] dv + c, \\tag{19.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(z_0\\) is a value close to the lower bound of the effective support of the distribution of \\(X^j\\) and \\(c\\) is a constant, usually selected so that \\(E_{X^j}\\left\\{g_{AL}^{f,j}(X^j)\\right\\} = 0\\). To interpret (19.7) note that \\(q^j(\\underline{x}^{j|=v})\\) describes the local effect (change) of the model due to \\(X^j\\). Or, to put it in other words, \\(q^j(\\underline{x}^{j|=v})\\) describes how much the CP profile for \\(X^j\\) changes at \\((x^1,\\ldots,x^{j-1},v,x^{j+1},\\ldots,x^p)\\). This effect (change) is averaged over the “relevant” (according to the conditional distribution of \\(\\underline{X}^{-j}|X^j\\)) values of \\(\\underline{x}^{-j}\\) and, subsequently, accumulated (integrated) over values of \\(v\\) up to \\(z\\). As argued by Apley and Zhu (2019), the averaging of the local effects allows avoiding the issue, present in the PD and LD profiles, of capturing the effect of other variables in the profile for a particular variable in additive models (without interactions). To see this, one can consider the approximation \\[ f(\\underline{x}^{j|=v+dv})-f(\\underline{x}^{j|=v}) \\approx q^j(\\underline{x}^{j|=v})dv, \\] and note that the difference \\(f(\\underline{x}^{j|=v+dv})-f(\\underline{v}^{j|=v})\\), for a model without interaction, effectively removes the effect of all variables other than \\(X^j\\). For example, consider model (19.1). In that case, \\(f(x^1,x^2)=x^1+x^2\\) and \\(q^1(\\underline{u}) = 1\\). Thus, \\[ f(u+du,x_2)-f(u,x_2) = (u + du + x^2) - (u + x^2) = du = q^1(u)du. \\] Consequently, irrespectively of the joint distribution of \\(X^1\\) and \\(X^2\\) and upon setting \\(c=z_0\\), we get \\[ g_{AL}^{x^1+x^2, 1}(z) = \\int_{z_0}^z \\left\\{E_{{X}^{2}|X^1=v}(1)\\right\\} dv + z_0 = z. \\] To estimate an AL profile, one replaces the integral in (19.7) by a summation and the derivative with a finite difference (Apley and Zhu 2019). In particular, consider a partition of the range of observed values \\(x_{i}^j\\) of variable \\(X^j\\) into \\(K\\) intervals \\(N_j(k)=\\left(z_{k-1}^j,z_k^j\\right]\\) (\\(k=1,\\ldots,K\\)). Note that \\(z_0^j\\) can be chosen just below \\(\\min(x_1^j,\\ldots,x_N^j)\\) and \\(z_K^j=\\max(x_1^j,\\ldots,x_N^j)\\). Let \\(n_j(k)\\) denote the number of observations \\(x_i^j\\) falling into \\(N_j(k)\\), with \\(\\sum_{k=1}^K n_j(k)=n\\). An estimator of AL profile for variable \\(X^j\\) can then be constructed as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{g}_{AL}^{f,j}(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{k_j(z)} \\frac{1}{n_j(k)} \\sum_{i: x_i^j \\in N_j(k)} \\left\\{ f\\left(\\underline{x}_i^{j| = z_k^j}\\right) - f\\left(\\underline{x}_i^{j| = z_{k-1}^j}\\right) \\right\\} - \\hat{c}, \\tag{19.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(k_j(z)\\) is the index of interval \\(N_j(k)\\) in which \\(z\\) falls, i.e., \\(z \\in N_j\\{k_j(z)\\}\\), and \\(\\hat{c}\\) is selected so that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\widehat{g}_{AL}^{f,j}(x_i^j)=0\\). To interpret (19.8) note that difference \\(f\\left(\\underline{x}_i^{j| = z_k^j}\\right) - f\\left(\\underline{x}_i^{j| = z_{k-1}^j}\\right)\\) corresponds to the difference of the CP profile for the \\(i\\)-th observation at the limits of interval \\(N_j(k)\\). These differences are then averaged across all observations, for which the observed value of \\(X^j\\) falls into the interval, and accumulated. Note that, in general, \\(\\widehat{g}_{AL}^{f,j}(z)\\) is not smooth at the boundaries of intervals \\(N_j(k)\\). A smooth estimate can obtained as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\widetilde{g}_{AL}^{f,j}(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^K \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sum_{l} w_l(z_k)} \\sum_{i=1}^N w_{i}(z_k) \\left\\{f\\left(\\underline{x}_i^{j| = z_k}\\right) - f\\left(\\underline{x}_i^{j| = z_k - \\Delta}\\right)\\right\\}\\right] - \\hat{c}, \\tag{19.9} \\end{equation}\\] where points \\(z_k\\) (\\(k=0, \\ldots, K\\)) form a uniform grid covering the interval \\((z_0,z)\\) with step \\(\\Delta = (z-z_0)/K\\), and weight \\(w_i(z_k)\\) captures the distance between point \\(z_k\\) and observation \\(x_i^j\\). In particular, we may use similar weights as in case of (19.5). 19.4 Example: apartment-prices data In this section, we use PD, LD, and AL profiles to evaluate performance of the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 (see Section 5.5.2) for the apartment-prices dataset (see Section 5.4). Recall that the goal is to predict the price per square meter of an apartment. In our illustration we focus on two explanatory variables, surface and number of rooms, as they are correlated (see Figure ??). Figure 19.4 shows the three types of profiles for both variables estimated according to formulas (18.2), (19.5), and (19.9). As we can see from the plots, the profiles calculated with different methods are different. The LD profiles are steeper than the PD profiles. This is because, for instance, the effect of surface includes the effect of other correlated variables, including number of rooms. The AL profile eliminates the effect of correlated variables. Since the AL and PD profiles are parallel to each other, they suggest that the model is additive for these two explanatory variables. Figure 19.4: Partial-dependence, local-dependence, and accumulated local profiles for the random-forest model for the apartment-prices dataset. 19.5 Pros and cons The LD and AL profiles, described in this chapter, are useful to summarize the influence of an explanatory variable on a model’s predictions. The profiles are constructed by using the CP profiles introduced in Chapter 11, but they differ in a way how the CP profiles for individual observations are summarized. When explanatory variables are independent and there are no interactions in the model, the CP profiles are parallel and their mean, i.e., the PD profile introduced in Chapter 18, adequately summarizes them. When the model is additive, but an explanatory variable is correlated with some other variables, neither PD nor LD profiles will properly capture the effect of the explanatory variable on the model’s predictions. However, the AL profile will provide a correct summary of the effect. When there are interactions in the model, none of the profiles will provide a correct assessment of the effect of an epxlanatory variable involved in interaction(s). This is because the profiles for the variable will also include the effect of other variables. Comparison of PD, LD, and AL profiles may help in identifying whether there are any interactions in the model and/or whether explanatory variables are correlated. When there are interactions, they may be explored by using a generalization of the PD profiles for two or more dependent variables (Apley and Zhu 2019). 19.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present the key features of the DALEX R package which is a part of the DrWhy.AI universe. The package covers the methods presented in this chapter. In particular, it includes wrappers for functions from the ingredients package (Biecek et al. 2019). Note that similar functionalities can be found in package ALEPlots (Apley 2018) or iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018). For illustration purposes, we use the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 (see Section 5.5.2) for the apartment prices dataset (see Section 5.4). Recall that the goal is to predict the price per square meter of an apartment. In our illustration, we focus on two explanatory variables, surface and number of rooms. We first load the model via the archivist hook, as listed in Section 5.5.6. Then we construct the explainer for the model by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). Note that, beforehand, we have got to load the randomForest package, as the model was fitted by using function randomForest() from this package (see Section 5.2.2) and it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available. model_apart_rf &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/fe7a5&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) model_apart_rf &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/fe7a5&quot;) explainer_apart_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = model_apart_rf, data = apartments_test[,-1], y = apartments_test$m2.price, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;, verbose = FALSE) The function that allows computation of LD and AL profiles in the DALEX package is model_profile(). Its use and arguments were described in Section 18.6. LD profiles are calculated by specifying argument type = \"conditional\". In the example below, we calculate the profile only for the explanatory variables surface and number of rooms. By default, the profile is based on 100 randomly selected observations. ld_rf &lt;- model_profile(explainer = explainer_apart_rf, type = &quot;conditional&quot;, variables = c(&quot;no.rooms&quot;, &quot;surface&quot;)) The resulting object of class “model_profile” contains the LD profiles for both explanatory variables. By applying the plot() function to the object, we obtain separate plots of the profiles. plot(ld_rf) + ggtitle(&quot;Local-dependence profiles for no. of rooms and surface&quot;) Figure 19.5: Local-dependence profiles for the random-forest model and explanatory variables surface and number of rooms for the apartment prices dataset. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 19.5. The profiles essentially correspond to those included in Figure 19.4. AL profiles are calculated by applying function model_profile() with the additional argument type = \"accumulated\". al_rf &lt;- model_profile(explainer = explainer_apart_rf, type = &quot;accumulated&quot;, variables = c(&quot;no.rooms&quot;, &quot;surface&quot;)) By applying the plot() function to the object, we obtain separate plots of the AL profiles for number of rooms and surface. They are presented in Figure 19.6. The profiles essentially correspond to those included in Figure 19.4. plot(al_rf) + ggtitle(&quot;Accumulated local profiles for no. of rooms and surface&quot;) Figure 19.6: Accumulated local profiles for the random-forest model and explanatory variables surface and number of rooms for the apartment prices dataset Function plot() allows including all plots in a single graph. We will show how to apply it in order to obtain Figure 19.4. Toward this end, we have got to create PD profiles first (see Section 18.6). We also modify the labels of the PD, LD, and AL profiles contained in the agr_profiles components of the “model_profile”-class objects created for the different profiles. pd_rf &lt;- model_profile(explainer = explainer_apart_rf, type = &quot;partial&quot;, variables = c(&quot;no.rooms&quot;, &quot;surface&quot;)) pd_rf$agr_profiles$`_label_` = &quot;partial dependence&quot; ld_rf$agr_profiles$`_label_` = &quot;local dependence&quot; al_rf$agr_profiles$`_label_` = &quot;accumulated local&quot; Subsequently, we simply apply the plot() function to the agr_profiles components of the “model_profile”-class objects for the different profiles (see Section 18.6). plot(pd_rf$agr_profiles, ld_rf$agr_profiles, al_rf$agr_profiles) The resulting plot (not shown) is essentially the same as the one presented in Figure 19.4, with a possible difference due to the use of a different set of (randomly selected) 100 observations from the apartment-prices dataset.

In particular, we focus on graphical methods that use residuals. The methods may be used for several purposes: In Part II of the book, we discussed tools for single-instance exploration. Residuals can be used to identify potentially problematic instances. The single-instance explainers can then be used in the problematic cases to understand, for instance, which factors contribute most to the errors in prediction. For most models, residuals should express a random behavior with certain properties (like, e.g., being concentrated around 0). If we find any systematic deviations from the expected behavior, they may signal an issue with a model (for instance, an omitted explanatory variable or a wrong functional form of a variable included in the model). In Chapter 16, we discussed measures to evaluate the overall performance of a predictive model. Sometimes, however, we may be more interested in cases with the largest errors of prediction, which can be identified with the help of residuals. Residual diagnostics is a classical topic related to statistical modeling. It is most often discussed in the context of evaluation of goodness-of-fit of a model. That is, residuals are computed using the training data and used to assess whether the model predictions “fit” the observed values of the dependent variable. Literature on the topic is vast – essentially every book on statistical modeling includes some discussion about residuals. Thus, in this chapter, we are not aiming at being exhaustive. Rather, our goal is to present selected concepts that underlie the use of residuals. 20.2 Intuition As it was mentioned in Section 2.3, we primarily focus on models describing the expected value of the dependent variable as a function of explanatory variables. In such case, for a “perfect” predictive model, the predicted value of the dependent variable should be exactly equal to the actual value of the variable for every observation. Perfect prediction is rarely, if ever, expected. In practice, we want the predictions to be reasonably close to the actual values. This suggests that we can use the difference between the predicted and the actual value of the dependent variable to quantify the quality of predictions obtained from a model. The difference is called a residual. For a single observation, residual will almost always be different from zero. While a large (absolute) value of a residual may indicate a problem with a prediction for a particular observation, it does not mean that the quality of predictions obtained from a model is unsatisfactory in general. To evaluate the quality, we should investigate the “behavior” of residuals for a group of observations. In other words, we should look at the distribution of the values of residuals. For a “good” model, residuals should deviate from zero randomly, i.e., not systematically. Thus, their distribution should be symmetric around zero, implying that their mean (or median) value should be zero. Also, residuals should be close to zero themselves, i.e., they should show low variability. Usually, to verify these properties, graphical methods are used. For instance, a histogram of can be used to check the symmetry and location of the distribution of residuals. Note that a model may imply a concrete distribution for residuals. In such a case, the distributional assumption can be verified by using a suitable graphical method like, for instance, a quantile-quantile plot. If the assumption is found to be violated, one might want to be careful when using predictions obtained from the model. 20.3 Method As it was already mentioned in Chapter 2, for a continuous dependent variable \\(Y\\), residual \\(r_i\\) for the \\(i\\)-th observation in a dataset is the difference between the observed value of \\(Y\\) and the corresponding model prediction: \\[\\begin{equation} r_i = y_i - f(\\underline{x}_i). \\tag{20.1} \\end{equation}\\] Standardized residuals are defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tilde{r}_i = \\frac{r_i}{\\sqrt{\\mbox{Var}(r_i)}}, \\tag{20.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mbox{Var}(r_i)\\) is the variance of the residual \\(r_i\\). Of course, in practice, the variance of \\(r_i\\) is usually unknown. Hence, the estimated value of \\(\\mbox{Var}(r_i)\\) is used in (20.2). Residuals defined in this way are often called the Pearson residuals (Galecki and Burzykowski 2013). Their distribution should be approximately standard-normal. For the classical linear-regression model, \\(\\mbox{Var}(r_i)\\) can be estimated by using the design matrix. On the other hand, for count data, the variance can be estimated by \\(f(\\underline{x}_i)\\), i.e., the expected value of the count. In general, for complicated models, it may be hard to estimate \\(\\mbox{Var}(r_i)\\), so it is often approximated by a constant for all residuals. Definition (20.2) can also be applied to a binary dependent variable if the model prediction \\(f(\\underline{x}_i)\\) is the probability of observing \\(y_i\\) and upon coding the two possible values of the variable as 0 and 1. However, in this case, the range of possible values of \\(r_i\\) is restricted to \\([-1,1]\\), which limits the usefulness of the residuals. For this reason, more often the Pearson residuals are used. Note that, if the values of the explanatory-variable vectors \\(\\underline{x}_i\\) lead to different predicted values \\(f(\\underline{x}_i)\\) for different observations in a dataset, the distribution of the Pearson residuals will not be approximated by the standard-normal one. Nevertheless, the index plot may still be useful to detect observations with large residuals. The standard-normal approximation is more likely to apply in the situation when vectors \\(\\underline{x}_i\\) split the data into (a few, perhaps) groups sharing the same predicted value \\(f(\\underline{x}_i)\\). In that case, one can consider averaging residuals \\(r_i\\) per group and standardizing them by \\(\\sqrt{f(\\underline{x}_i)\\{1-f(\\underline{x}_i)/k\\}}\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of observations in a particular group. For categorical data, residuals can only be defined in terms of residuals for the binary variables indicating the category observed for the \\(i\\)-th observation. Let us consider the classical linear-regression model. In that case, residuals should be normally distributed with mean zero and a constant variance. Figure 20.1 presents examples of plots that can be used to check whether the assumptions are fulfilled. In fact, the plots in Figure 20.1 suggest issues with the assumptions. In particular, the top-left panel presents the residuals in function of the estimated linear combination of explanatory variables, i.e., predicted (fitted) values. For a well-fitting model, the plot should show points scattered symmetrically around the horizontal straight line at 0. However, the scatter in the top-left panel of Figure 20.1 has got a shape of a funnel, reflecting increasing variability of residuals for increasing fitted values. This indicates a violation of the homoscedasticity, i.e., constancy of variance, assumption. Also, the smoothed line suggests that the mean of residuals becomes increasingly positive for increasing fitted values. This indicates a violation of the assumption that residuals have got zero-mean. The top-right panel of Figure 20.1 presents the scale-location plot, i.e., the plot of \\(\\sqrt{\\tilde{r}_i}\\) in function of the fitted values \\(f(\\underline{x}_i)\\). For a well-fitting model, the plot should show points scattered symmetrically across the horizontal axis. This is clearly not the case of the plot in Figure 20.1, which indicates a violation of the homoscedasticity assumption. The bottom-left panel of Figure 20.1 presents the plot of standardized residuals in function of leverage. Leverage is a measure of the distance between \\(\\underline{x}_i\\) and the vector of mean values for all explanatory variables (Kutner et al. 2005). A large leverage value for the \\(i\\)-th observation, say \\(l_i\\), indicates that \\(\\underline{x}_i\\) is distant from the center of all observed values of the vector of explanatory variables. Importantly, a large leverage value implies that the observation may have an important influence on predicted/fitted values. In fact, for the classical linear-regression model it can be shown that the predicted sum-of-squares, defined in (16.5), can be written as \\[\\begin{equation} PRESS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\widehat{y}_{i(-i)} - y_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{r_i^2}{(1-l_{i})^2}. \\tag{20.3} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, (20.3) indicates that observations with a large \\(r_i\\) (or \\(\\tilde{r}_i\\)) and a large \\(l_i\\) have an important influence on the overall predictive performance of the model. Hence, the plot of standardized residuals in function of leverage can be used to detect such influential observations. Note that plot can also be used to check homoscedasticity because, under that assumption, it should show a symmetric scatter of points around the horizontal line at 0. This is not the case of the plot presented in the bottom-left panel of Figure 20.1. Hence, the plot suggests that the assumption is not fulfilled. However, it does not indicate any particular influential observations, which should be located in the upper-right or lower-right corners of the plot, above the dashed red line. [TOMASZ: IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE THE DASHED LINE FOR COOK’S DISTANCE INDICATED IN THE PLOT.] Note that the the plot of standardized residuals in function of leverage can also be used to detect observations with large differences between the predicted and observed value of the dependent variable. In particular, given that \\({\\tilde{r}_i}\\) should have approximately standard-normal distribution, only about 0.5% of them should be larger, in absolute value, than 2.57. If there is an excess of such observations, this could taken as a signal of issues with the fit of the model. At least two such observations (59 and 143) are indicated in the plot shown in the bottom-left panel of Figure 20.1. [TOMASZ: WHAT IS THE CRITERION FOR SELECTING THE OBSERVATIONS IN THE PLOT?] Finally, the bottom-right panel of Figure 20.1 presents an example of a normal quantile-quantile plot. In particular, the vertical axis represents the ordered values of the standardized residuals, whereas the horizontal axis represents the corresponding values expected from the standard normal distribution. If the normality assumption is fulfilled, the plot should show a scatter of points close to the \\(45^{\\circ}\\) diagonal. Clearly, this is not the case of the plot in the bottom-right panel of Figure 20.1. [TOMASZ: WOULD BE WORTH TO HAVE A DIAGONAL REFERENCE LINE THERE.] Figure 20.1: Diagnostic plots for a linear-regression model. Clockwise from the top-left: residuals as a function of fitted values, a scale-location plot, a nomal quantile-quantile plot, and a leverage plot. 20.4 Example: apartment-prices data In this section, we consider the linear-regression model apartments_lm_v5 (Section 5.5.1) and the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 (Section 5.5.2) for the apartment-prices dataset (Section 5.4). Recall that the dependent variable of interest, the price per square meter, is continuous. Thus, we can use residuals \\(r_i\\), as defined in (20.1). We compute the residuals for the apartments_test testing dataset (see Section 5.5.4). It is worth noting that, as it was mentioned in Section 16.4.1, RMSE for both models is very similar for that dataset. Thus, overall, the two models could be seen as performing similarly. Figures 20.2 and 20.3 summarize the distribution of residuals for both models. In particular, Figure 20.2 presents histograms of residuals, while Figure 20.3 shows box-and-whisker plots for the absolute value of the residuals. Figure 20.2: Histogram of residuals for the linear-regression model apartments_lm_v5 and the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 for the apartments_test dataset. [TOMASZ: REVIEWER SUGGESTS USING THE SAME ORDER, E.G. LM-RF.] Despite the similar value of RMSE, the distribution of residuals for both models is different. In particular, Figure 20.2 indicates that the distribution for the linear-regression model is, in fact, split into two separate, normal-like parts, which may suggest omission of a binary explanatory variable in the model. The two components are located around the values of about -200 and 400. As mentioned in the previous chapters, the reason for this behavior of the residuals is the fact that the model does not capture the non-linear relationship between the price and the year of construction. [TOMASZ: THIS IS NOT REALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE REMARK ABOUT A MISSING BINARY VARIABLE.] As seen from Figure 20.2, the distribution of residuals for the random-forest model is skewed to the right and multimodal. It seems to be centered at a value closer to zero than the distribution for the linear-regression model, but it shows a larger variation. These conclusions are confirmed by the box-and-whisker plots in Figure 20.3. Figure 20.3: Box-and-whisker plots of the absolute values of the residuals of the linear-regression model apartments_lm_v5 and the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 for the apartments_test dataset. The dots indicate the mean value that corresponds to root-mean-squared-error. [TOMASZ: REVIEWER SUGGESTS USING THE SAME ORDER, E.G. LM-RF.] The plots in Figures 20.2 and 20.3 suggest that the residuals for the random-forest model are more frequently smaller than the residuals for the linear-regression model. However, a fraction of the random-forest-model residuals is very large and it is due to them that the RMSE is comparable for the two models. In the remainder of the section, we focus on the random-forest model. Figure 20.4 shows a scatter plot of residuals (vertical axis) in function of the observed (horizontal axis) values of the dependent variable. For a “perfect” predictive model, we would expect the horizontal line at zero. For a “good” model, we would like to see a symmetric scatter of points around the horizontal line at zero, indicating random deviations of predictions from the observed values. The plot in Figure 20.4 shows that, for the large observed values of the dependent variable, the residuals are positive, while for small values they are negative. This trend is clearly captured by the smoothed curve included in the graph. Thus, the plot suggests that the predictions are shifted (biased) towards the average. Figure 20.4: Residuals and observed values of the dependent variable for the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 for the apartments_test dataset. [TOMASZ: WHY DOES THE SUB-TITLE INDICATE Y VS. RESIDUAL?] The shift towards the average can also be seen from Figure 20.5 that shows a scatter plot of the predicted (vertical axis) and observed (horizontal axis) values of the dependent variable. For a “perfectly” fitting model we would expect a diagonal line (indicated in red). The plot shows that, for large observed values of the dependent variable, the predictions are smaller than the observed values, with an opposite trend for the small observed values of the dependent variable. Figure 20.5: Predicted and observed values of the dependent variable for the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 for the apartments_test dataset. The red line indicates the diagonal. [TOMASZ: WHY DOES THE SUB-TITLE INDICATE Y VS. YHAT?] Figure 20.6 shows an index plot of residuals, i.e., their scatter plot in function of an (arbitrary) identifier of the observation (horizontal axis). The plot indicates an asymmetric distribution of residuals around zero, as there is an excess of large positive (larger than 500) residuals without a corresponding fraction of negative values. This can be linked to the right-skewed distribution seen in Figures 20.2 and 20.3 for the random-forest model. Figure 20.6: Index plot of residuals for the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 for the apartments_test dataset. [TOMASZ: WHY DOES THE SUB-TITLE INDICATE RESIDUALS VS. ID?] Figure 20.7 shows a scatter plot of residuals (vertical axis) in function of the predicted (horizontal axis) value of the dependent variable. For a “good” model, we would like to see a symmetric scatter of points around the horizontal line at zero. The plot in Figure 20.7, as the one in Figure 20.4, suggests that the predictions are shifted (biased) towards the average. Figure 20.7: Residuals and predicted values of the dependent variable for the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 for the apartments_test dataset. [TOMASZ: WHY DOES THE SUB-TITLE INDICATE YHAT VS. RESIDUALS?] The random-forest model, as the linear-regression model, assumes that residuals should be homoscedastic, i.e., that they should have a constant variance. Figure 20.8 presents a variant of the scale-location plot of residuals, i.e., a scatterplot of the absolute value of residuals (vertical axis) in function of the predicted values of the dependent variable (horizontal axis). The plot includes a smoothed line capturing the average trend. For homoscedastic residuals, we would expect a symmetric scatter around a horizontal line; the smoothed trend should be also horizontal. The plot in Figure 20.8 deviates from the expected pattern and indicates that the variability of the residuals depends on the (predicted) value of the dependent variable. [TOMASZ; I WOULD SAY THAT HOMOSCEDASTICITY IS IMPORTANT FOR GOF; FOR GOP, PERHAPS LESS SO. WORTH SHOWING?] plot(md_rf, variable = &quot;y_hat&quot;, yvariable = &quot;abs_residuals&quot;) + xlab(&quot;predicted price&quot;) + ylab(&quot;absolute value of residuals&quot;) Figure 20.8: The scale-location plot of residuals for the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 for the apartments_test dataset. [TOMASZ: WHY DOES THE SUB-TITLE INDICATE YHAT VS. ABS_RESIDUALS?] 20.5 Pros and cons Diagnostic methods based on residuals are a very useful tool in model exploration. They allow identifying different types of issues with model fit or prediction, such as problems with distributional assumptions or with the assumed structure of the model (in terms of the selection of the explanatory variables and their form). The methods can help in detecting groups of observations for which a model’s predictions are biased and, hence, require inspection. A potential complication related to the use of residual diagnostics is that they rely on graphical displays. Hence, for a proper evaluation of a model, one may have to contruct and review many graphs. Moreover, interpretation of the patterns seen in graphs may not be straightforward. Also, it may not be immediately obvious which element of the model may have to be changed to remove the potential issue with the model fit or predictions. 20.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present the key features of the DALEX R package which is a part of the DrWhy.AI universe. The package covers the methods presented in this chapter. Note that it is a wrapper for functions from the auditor package (Gosiewska and Biecek 2018). For illustration purposes, we will show how to create the plots shown in Section 20.4 for the linear-regression model apartments_lm_v5 (Section 5.5.1) and the random-forest model apartments_rf_v5 (Section 5.5.2) for the apartments_test dataset (Section 5.4). We first load the two models via the archivist hooks, as listed in Section 5.5.6. Subsequently, we construct the corresponding explainers by using function explain() from the DALEX package (see Section 5.2.6). Note that we use the apartments_test data frame without the first column, i.e., the m2.price variable, in the data argument. This will be the dataset to which the model will be applied. The m2.price variable is explicitly specified as the dependent variable in the y argument. We also load the randomForest package, as it is important to have the corresponding predict() function available for the random-forest model. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) model_apart_lm &lt;- archivist:: aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/55f19&quot;) model_apart_rf &lt;- archivist:: aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/fe7a5&quot;) explain_apart_lm &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = model_apart_lm, data = apartments_test[,-1], y = apartments_test$m2.price, label = &quot;Linear Regression&quot;, verbose = FALSE) explain_apart_rf &lt;- DALEX::explain(model = model_apart_rf, data = apartments_test[,-1], y = apartments_test$m2.price, label = &quot;Random Forest&quot;, verbose = FALSE) For exploration of residuals, DALEX includes two useful functions. The DALEX::model_performance() function can be used to evaluate the distribution of the residuals. On the other hand, the DALEX::model_diagnostics() function is suitable for investigating the relationship between residuals and other variables. The model_performance() function was already introduced in Section 16.6. Application of the function to an explainer-object returns an object of class “model_performance” which includes, in addition to selected model-performance measures, a data frame containing the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable together with the residuals. mr_lm &lt;- DALEX::model_performance(explain_apart_lm) mr_rf &lt;- DALEX::model_performance(explain_apart_rf) By applying the plot() function to a “model_performance”-class object we can obtain various plots. The required type of the plot is specified with the help of the geom argument (see Section 16.6). In particular, specifying geom = \"histogram\" results in a histogram of residuals. In the code below, we apply the plot() function to the “model_performance”-class objects for the linear-regression and random-forest models. As a result, we automatically get a single graph with the histograms of residuals for the two models. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 20.2 library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) plot(mr_lm, mr_rf, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;) The box-and-whisker plots of the residuals for the two models can be constructed by applying the geom = \"boxplot\" argument. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 20.3, plot(mr_lm, mr_rf, geom = &quot;boxplot&quot;) Function model_diagnostics() can be applied to an explainer-object to directly compute residuals. The resulting object of class “model_diagnostics” is a data frame in which the residuals and their absolute values are combined with the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable and the observed values of the explanatory variables. The data frame can be used to create various plots illustrating the relationship between residuals and the other variables. md_lm &lt;- model_diagnostics(explain_apart_lm) md_rf &lt;- model_diagnostics(explain_apart_rf) Application of the plot() function to a “model_diagnostics”-class object produces, by default, a scatter plot of residuals (on the vertical axis) in function of the predicted values of the dependent variable (on the horizontal axis). By using arguments variable and yvariable, it is possible to specify plots with other variables used for the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The two arguments accept, apart from the names of the explanatory variables, the following values: \"y\" for the dependent variable, \"y_hat\" for the predicted value of the dependent variable, \"obs\" for the identifiers of observations, \"residuals\" for residuals, \"abs_residuals\" for absolute values of residuals. Thus, to obtain the plot of residuals in function of the observed values of the dependent variable, as shown in Figure 20.4, the syntax presented below can be used. plot(md_rf, variable = &quot;y&quot;, yvariable = &quot;residuals&quot;) To produce Figure 20.5, we have got to use the predicted values of the dependent variable on the vertical axis. This is achieved by specifying the yvariable = \"y_hat\" argument. We add the diagonal reference line to the plot by using the geom_abline() function. plot(md_rf, variable = &quot;y&quot;, yvariable = &quot;y_hat&quot;) + geom_abline(colour = &quot;red&quot;, intercept = 0, slope = 1) Figure 20.6 presents an index plot of residuals, i.e., residuals (on the vertical axis) in function of identifiers of individual observations (on the horizontal axis). Toward this aim, we use the plot() function call as below. plot(md_rf, variable = &quot;ids&quot;, yvariable = &quot;residuals&quot;) Finally, Figure 20.8 presents a variant of the scale-location plot, with absolute values of the residuals shown on the vertical scale and the predicted values of the dependent variable on the horizontal scale. The plot is obtained with the syntax shown below. plot(md_rf, variable = &quot;y_hat&quot;, yvariable = &quot;abs_residuals&quot;) Note that, by default, all plots produced by applying the plot() function to a “model_diagnostics”-class object include a smoothed curve. To exclude the curve from a plot, one can use the argument smooth = FALSE. References "],

Different methods were discussed in separate chapters, and while illustrated, they were not directly compared. Thus, in this chapter, we apply the methods to one dataset in order to present their relative merits. In particular, we present an example of a full process of a model development along the lines introduced in Chapter 2. This will allow use to show how one can combine results from the different methods. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) is a governing body of football (sometimes, especially in the USA, called soccer). FIFA is also a series of video games developed by EA Sports which faithfully reproduces the characteristics of real players. FIFA ratings of football players from the video game can be found at https://sofifa.com/. Data from this website for 2019 were scrapped and made available at the Kaggle webpage https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19. We will use the data to build a predictive model for evaluation of a player’s value. Subsequently, we will use the model exploration and explanation methods to better understand the model’s performance, as well as which variables and how influence a player’s value. 21.2 Data preparation The original dataset contains 89 variables that describe 16,924 players. The variables include information such as age, nationality, club, wage, etc. In what follows, we focus on 45 variables that are included in data frame fifa included in the DALEX package for R and Pythin. The variables from this data set are listed below. Name Weak.Foot FKAccuracy Jumping Composure Club Skill.Moves LongPassing Stamina Marking Position Crossing BallControl Strength StandingTackle Value.EUR Finishing Acceleration LongShots SlidingTackle Age HeadingAccuracy SprintSpeed Aggression GKDiving Overall ShortPassing Agility Interceptions GKHandling Special Volleys Reactions Positioning GKKicking Preferred.Foot Dribbling Balance Vision GKPositioning International.Reputation Curve ShotPower Penalties GKReflexes In particular, variable Value.EUR contains player’s value in millions of EUR. This will be our dependent variable. The distribution of the variable is heavily skewed to the right. In particular, the quartiles are equal to 325,000 EUR, 725,000 EUR, and 2,534,478 EUR. There are three players with a value higher than 100 millions of Euro. Thus, in our analyses we will consider a logarithmically-transformed player’s value. Figure 21.1 presents the empirical cumulative-distribution function and histogram for the transformed value. They indicate that the transformation makes the distribution less skewed. Figure 21.1: The empirical cumulative-distribution function and histogram for the log\\(_{10}\\)-transformed players’ values. Additionally, we take a closer look at four characteristics that will be considered as explanatory variables later in this chapter. These are: Age, Reactions (a movement skill), BallControl (a general skill), and Dribbling (a general skill). Figure 21.2 presents histograms of the values of the four variables. From the plot for Age we can conclude that most of the players are between 20 and 30 years of age (median age: 25). Variable Reactions has an approximately symmetric distribution, with quartiles equal to 56, 62, and 68. Histograms of BallControl and Dribbling indicate, interestingly, bimodal distributions. The smaller modes are due to goalkeepers. Figure 21.2: Histograms for selected characteristics of players. 21.2.1 Code snippets for R The subset of 5000 most valuable players from FIFA 19 data is avaliable in fifa data frame in the DALEX package. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) head(fifa) 21.2.2 Code snippets for Python The subset of 5000 most valuable players from FIFA 19 data can be loaded to Python with dalex.datasets.load_fifa() method. import dalex as dx fifa = dx.datasets.load_fifa() 21.3 Data understanding We will investigate the relationship between the four selected characteristics and the (logarithmically-transformed) player’s value. Toward this aim, we use the scatter plots shown in Figure 21.3. Each plot includes a smoothed curve capturing the trend. For Age, the relationship is not monotonic. There seems to be an optimal age, between 25 and 30 years, at which player’s value reaches the maximum. On the other hand, the value of youngest and oldest players is about 10 times lower, as compared to the maximum. For variables BallControl and Dribbling, the relationship is not monotonic. In general, the larger value of these coefficients, the large value of a player. However, there are “local” maxima for players with low scores for BallControl and Dribbling. As it was suggested earlier, these are probably goalkeepers. For Reactions, the association with player’s value is monotonic, with increasing values of the variable leading to increasing values of players. Figure 21.3: Scatter plots illustrating the relationship between the (logarithmically-transformed) player’s value and selected characteristics. Figure 21.4 presents the scatter-plot matrix for the four selected variables. It indicates that all variables are positively correlated, though with a different strength. In particular, BallControl and Dribbling are strongly correlated, with the estimated correlation coefficient larger than 0.9. Reactions is moderately correlated with the other three variables. Finally, there is a moderate correlation between Age and Reactions, but not much correlation with BallControl and Dribbling. Figure 21.4: Scatter-plot matrix illustrating the relationship between selected characteristics of players. 21.4 Model assembly In this section, we develop a model for players’ values. We consider all variables other than Name, Club, Position, Value.EUR, Overall, and Special (see Section 21.2) as explanatory variables. The base-10 logarithm of player’s value is the dependent variable. Given different possible forms of relationship between the (logarithmically-transformed) player’s value and explanatory variables (as seen, for example, in Figure 21.3), we build four different, flexible models to check whether they are capable of capturing the various relationships. In particular, we consider the following models: a boosting model with 250 trees of 1-level depth, as implemented in package gbm (Ridgeway 2017), a boosting model with 250 trees of 4-levels depth (this model should be able to catch interactions between variables), a random-forest model with 250 trees, as implemented in package ranger (Wright and Ziegler 2017), a linear model with a spline-transformation of explanatory variables, as implemented in package rms (Harrell Jr 2018). These models will be explored in detail in the following sections. 21.4.1 Code snippets for R In this chapter we will show R snippets how the gradient boosting model was built. Other models were built in a similar way. The code below fits the models to the data. The dependent variable LogValue contains the base-10 logarithm of Value.EUR, i.e., player’s value. fifa$LogValue &lt;- log10(fifa$Value.EUR) fifa_small &lt;- fifa[,-c(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)] fifa_gbm_deep &lt;- gbm(LogValue~., data = fifa_small, n.trees = 250, interaction.depth = 4, distribution = &quot;gaussian&quot;) For model-exploration purposes, we have got to create explainer objects with the help of the DALEX::explain() function (see Section 5.2.6). For a single model the code is provided below. Note that the models were fitted to the logarithmically-transformed player’s value. However, it is more natural to interpret the predictions on the original scale. This is why, in the provided syntax, we apply the predict_function argument to specify a user-defined function to obtain predictions on the original scale, in Euro. Additionally, we use the data and y arguments to indicate the data frame with explanatory variables and the values of the dependent variable, for which predictions are to be obtained. Finally, each model receives its own label. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) fifa_gbm_exp_deep &lt;- DALEX::explain(fifa_gbm_deep, data = fifa_small, y = 10^fifa_small$LogValue, predict_function = function(m,x) 10^predict(m, x, n.trees = 250), label = &quot;GBM deep&quot;) 21.4.2 Code snippets for Python In this chapter we will show Python snippets how the gradient boosting model was built. Other models were built in a similar way. The code below fits the models to the data. The dependent variable ylog contains the logarithm of value_eur, i.e., player’s value. from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor X = fifa.drop([&quot;nationality&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;, &quot;potential&quot;, &quot;value_eur&quot;, &quot;wage_eur&quot;], axis = 1) y = fifa[&#39;value_eur&#39;] ylog = np.log(y) X_train, X_test, ylog_train, ylog_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, ylog, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=4) gbm_model = LGBMRegressor() gbm_model.fit(X_train, ylog_train, verbose = False) For model-exploration purposes, we have to create explainer objects (see Section 5.3.6). The code is provided below. Note that the models were fitted to the logarithmically-transformed player’s value. However, it is more natural to interpret the predictions on the original scale. This is why, in the provided syntax, we apply the predict_function argument to specify a user-defined function to obtain predictions on the original scale, in Euro. Additionally, we use the X and y arguments to indicate the data frame with explanatory variables and the values of the dependent variable, for which predictions are to be obtained. Finally, each model receives its own label. def predict_function(model, data): return np.exp(model.predict(data)) fifa_gbm_exp = dx.Explainer(gbm_model, X_test, y_test, predict_function=predict_function, label = &#39;gbm&#39;) 21.5 Model audit Having developed the four candidate models, we may want to evaluate their performance. Toward this aim, we can use the measures discussed in Section 16.3.1. They can be computed with the help of function model_performance() (see Section 16.6), as indicated below. mse rmse r2 mad GBM shallow 8.990694e+12 2998449 0.7300429 183682.91 GBM deep 2.211439e+12 1487091 0.9335987 118425.56 RF 1.141176e+12 1068258 0.9657347 50693.24 RM 2.191297e+13 4681129 0.3420350 148187.06 On average, the values of the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and mean-absolute-deviation (MAD) are the smallest for the random-forest model. In addition to computing measures of the overall performance of the model, we should conduct a more detailed examination of both overall- and instance-specific performance. Toward this aim, we can apply residual diagnostics, as discussed in Chapter 20. Subsequently, we can create, for instance, a plot comparing the predicted (fitted) and observed values of the dependent variable. Figure 21.5: Observed and predicted (fitted) player’s values for the four developed models. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 21.5. It indicates that predictions are closest to the observed values of the dependent variable for the random-forest model. It is worth noting that the smoothed trend for the model is close to a straight line, but with a slope smaller than 1. This implies the random-forest model underestimates the actual value of the most expensive players, while it overestimates the value for the least expensive ones. A similar pattern can be observed for the gradient-boosting models. This “shrinking to the mean” is typical for this type of models. 21.5.1 Code snippets for R In this chapter we will show R snippets for model audit for the gradient boosting model. Other models were audited in a similar way. The model_performance() function is used to calculate RMSE, MSE, MAD and other performance measures for considered models. model_performance(fifa_gbm_exp_deep) The model_diagnostics() function (see Section 20.6) allows creation of various residual-based plots. Results of this function can be visualised with the generic plot() function. In the code below additional beautifier are used for both axes. fifa_md_gbm_deep &lt;- model_diagnostics(fifa_gbm_exp_deep) plot(fifa_md_gbm_deep, variable = &quot;y&quot;, yvariable = &quot;y_hat&quot;) + scale_x_continuous(&quot;Value in Euro&quot;, trans = &quot;log10&quot;, labels = dollar_format(suffix = &quot;€&quot;, prefix = &quot;&quot;)) + scale_y_continuous(&quot;Predicted value in Euro&quot;, trans = &quot;log10&quot;, labels = dollar_format(suffix = &quot;€&quot;, prefix = &quot;&quot;)) + geom_abline(slope = 1) + ggtitle(&quot;Predicted and observed player&#39;s values&quot;, &quot;&quot;) 21.6 Model understanding (dataset-level explanation) All four developed models involve many explanatory variables. It is of interest to understand which of them exercises the largest influence of models’ predictions. Toward this aim, we can apply the permutation-based variable-importance measure discussed in Chapter 17. Subsequently, we can construct a plot of the obtained mean (over the default 10 permutations) variable-importance measures. Note that we consider only the top 20. plot(fifa_mp_gbm_shallow, fifa_mp_gbm_deep, fifa_mp_rf, fifa_mp_rm, max_vars = 20, bar_width = 4, show_boxplots = FALSE) + ggtitle(&quot;Feature Importance&quot;, &quot;&quot;) Figure 21.6: Mean variable-importance calculated using 10 permutations for the four developed models. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 21.6. The bars for each explanatory variable start at the RMSE value of a particular model and end at the (mean) RMSE calculated for data with permuted values of the variable. Figure 21.6 indicates that, for the gradient-booting and random-forest models, the two explanatory variables with the largest values of the importance measure are Reactions or BallControl. The importance of other variables varies depending on the model. Interestingly, in the linear-regression model, the highest importance is given to goal-keeping skills. We may also want to take a look at the partial-dependence (PD) profiles discussed in Chapter 18. Recall that they illustrate how the expected value of a model’s predictions behaves as a function of an explanatory variable. To create the profiles, we apply function model_profile() from the DALEXpackage (see Section 18.6). We focus on variables Reactions, BallControl, and Dribbling that were important in the random-forest model (see Figure 21.6). We also consider Age, as it had some effect in the gradient-boosting models. Subsequently, we can construct a plot of contrastive PD profiles (see Section 18.3.4). Figure 21.7: Contrastive partial-dependence profiles for the four developed models and selected explanatory variables. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 21.7. For Reactions, BallControl, and Dribbling the shape of the profiles is, in general, similar for all the models and implies an increasing predicted player’s value for an increasing (at least, after passing some threshold) value of the explanatory variable. However, for Age, the shape is different and suggests a decreasing player’s value after the age of about 25 years. It is worth noting that the range of expected model’s predictions is, in general, the smallest for the random-forest model. Also, the three tree-based models tend to stabilize the predictions at the ends of the explanatory-variable ranges. The most interesting difference between the conclusions drawn from Figure 21.3 and those obtained from Figure 21.7 is observed for variable Age. In particular, Figure 21.3 suggests that the relationship between player’s age and value is non-monotonic, while Figure 21.7 suggests a non-increasing relationship. How can we explain this difference? A possible explanation is as follows. The youngest players have lower values not because of their age, but because of their lower skills, which are correlated (as seen from the scatter-plot matrix in Figure 21.4) with young age. The simple data exploration analysis, presented in the upper-left panel of Figure 21.3, cannot separate the effects of age and skills. As a result, the analysis suggests a decrease of player’s value for the youngest players. In models, however, the effect of age is estimated while adjusting for the effect of skills. After this adjustment, the effect takes the form of a non-increasing pattern, as shown by the PD profiles for Age in Figure 21.7. This example indicates that exploration of models may provide more insight than exploration of raw data. In exploratory data analysis, the effect of variable Age was confounded by the effect of skill-related variables. By using a model, the confounding has been removed. 21.6.1 Code snippets for R In this chapter we will show R snippets for model-level exploration for the gradient boosting model. Other models were audited in a similar way. The model_parts() function from the DALEXpackage (see Section 17.6) is used to calculate feature importance via feature permutations. The generic plot() function visualizes these statistics. The max_vars argument limit number of presented variable up to 20. fifa_mp_gbm_deep &lt;- model_parts(fifa_gbm_exp_deep) plot(fifa_mp_gbm_deep, max_vars = 20, bar_width = 4, show_boxplots = FALSE) The model_profile() function from the DALEXpackage (see Section 18.6) is used to calculate partial dependence profiles. The generic plot() function visualizes these profiles for selected variables. selected_variables &lt;- c(&quot;Reactions&quot;, &quot;BallControl&quot;, &quot;Dribbling&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;) fifa19_pd_deep &lt;- model_profile(fifa_gbm_exp_deep, variables = selected_variables) plot(fifa19_pd_deep) 21.6.2 Code snippets for Python In this chapter we will show Python snippets for model-level exploration for the gradient boosting model. Other models were audited in a similar way. The model_parts method from the dalex library (see Section 17.7) is used to calculate feature importance via feature permutations. The plot() method visualizes these statistics. fifa_mp_gbm = fifa_gbm.model_parts() fifa_mp_gbm.plot(max_vars=20) The model_profile method from the dalex library (see Section ??) is used to calculate partial dependence profiles. The plot() method visualizes these profiles for selected variables. fifa_mp_gbm = fifa_gbm.model_profile() fifa_mp_gbm.plot(variables = [&#39;Reactions&#39;, &#39;BallControl&#39;, &#39;Dribbling&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;]) 21.7 Instance-level explanation After evaluation of the models at the dataset-level, we may want to focus on particular instances. 21.7.1 Robert Lewandowski As a first example, we take a look at the value of Robert Lewandowski, for an obvious reason. Below we list his characteristics, as included in the analyzed dataset.

Recall that they decompose model’s prediction into parts that can be attributed to different explanatory variables. The attributions can be presented in a break-down (BD) plot. The method is implemented in function predict_parts() (see Section 7.6). We first compute the necessary measures. For brevity, we only consider the random-forest model. Subsequently, we create the BD plot. Figure 21.8: Break-down plot for Robert Lewandowski for the random-forest model. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 21.8. It suggests that the explanatory variables with the largest effect are Composure, Volleys, LongShots, and Stamina. However, in Chapter 7 it was mentioned that variable attributions may depend on the order of explanatory covariates that is used in calculations. Thus, in Chapter 9 we introduced Shapley values, based on the idea of averaging the attributions over many orderings. Shapley values are implemented in function predict_parts() (see Section 7.6). We apply the function to the explainer-object for the random-forest model while specifying argument type = \"shap\". Note that Shapley values are computed by using 25 random orderings (see Section 9.5). Subsequently, we create the plot illustrating the computed values. Figure 21.9: Shapley values for Robert Lewandowski for the random-forest model. The resulting plot is presented in Figure 21.9. It indicates that the five explanatory variables with the largest Shapley values are BallControl, Dribbling, Reactions, ShortPassing, and Positioning. This makes sense, as Robert Lewandowski is a striker. In Chapter 11, we introduced ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles. They capture the effect of a selected explanatory variable in terms of changes of a model’s prediction induced by changes in the variable’s values. The profiles can be obtained with the help of function predict_profiles() package (see Section 11.6). Figure 21.10: Ceteris-paribus profiles for Robert Lewandowski for four selected variables and the random-forest model. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 21.10. It suggests that, among the four variables, BallControl and Reactions lead to the largest changes of predictions for this instance. For all four variables, the profiles flatten at the left- and right-hand-side edges. The predicted value of Robert Lewandowski reaches or is very close to the maximum for all four profiles. It is interesting to note that, for Age, the predicted value is located at the border of the age region at which the profile suggests a sharp drop in player’s value. As it was argued in Chapter 13, it is worthwhile to check how the model behaves for observations similar to the instance of interest. Towards this aim, we may want to compare the distribution of residuals for “neighbors” of Robert Lewandowski. Subsequently, we construct a plot that shows the histogram of residuals for all data and the 30 neighbors. Figure 21.11: Distribution of residuals for all players and neighbors of Robert Lewandowski. The resulting plot is presented in Figure 21.11. Clearly, the neighbors of Robert Lewandowski include some of the most expensive players. Therefore, as compared to the overall distribution, the distribution of residuals for the neighbors is skewed to the right and their mean is larger as the overall mean. Thus, the model underestimates the actual value of the most expensive players. This was also noted based on the plot in the bottom-left panel of Figure 21.5. We can also look at the local-stability plot, i.e., the plot that includes CP profiles for the nearest neighbors and the corresponding residuals (see Chapter 13). We will limit ourselves to the plot for Age. Figure 21.12: Local-stability plot for age for 30 neighbors of Robert Lewandowski and the random-forest model. The resulting local-stability plot is presented in Figure 21.12. The CP profiles are almost parallel, but span quite a wide range of the predicted player’s values. Thus, one could conclude that the predictions for the most expensive players are not very stable. Also, the plot includes more positive residuals (indicated in the plot by green vertical intervals) than negative ones (indicated by red vertical intervals). This confirms the conclusion drawn from Figure 21.11 that the values of the most expensive players are underestimated by the model. 21.7.2 Code snippets for R In this chapter we will show R snippets for instance-level exploration for the gradient boosting model. Other models were audited in a similar way. The predict_parts() function from the DALEXpackage (see Chapters 7-9) is used to calculate variable attribution. The generic plot() function visualizes these attribution. Use type = \"break_down\" to calculate break-down plots. fifa_bd_gbm &lt;- predict_parts(fifa_gbm_exp, new_observation = fifa[&quot;R. Lewandowski&quot;,], type = &quot;break_down&quot;) plot(fifa_bd_gbm) + scale_y_continuous(&quot;Predicted value in Euro&quot;, labels = dollar_format(suffix = &quot;€&quot;, prefix = &quot;&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Break-down plot for Robert Lewandowski&quot;,&quot;&quot;) Or use type = \"shap\" to calculate Shapley values. fifa_shap_gbm &lt;- variable_attribution(fifa_gbm_exp, new_observation = fifa[&quot;R. Lewandowski&quot;,], type = &quot;shap&quot;) plot(fifa_shap_gbm, show_boxplots = FALSE) + scale_y_continuous(&quot;Estimated value in Euro&quot;, labels = dollar_format(suffix = &quot;€&quot;, prefix = &quot;&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Shapley values for Robert Lewandowski&quot;,&quot;&quot;) The predict_profile() function from the DALEX package (see Section 11.6) is used to calculate cateris paribus profiles. The generic plot() function visualizes these profiles for selected variables. selected_variables &lt;- c(&quot;Reactions&quot;, &quot;BallControl&quot;, &quot;Dribbling&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;) fifa_cp_gbm &lt;- predict_profile(fifa_gbm_exp, new_observation = fifa[&quot;R. Lewandowski&quot;,], variables = selected_variables) plot(fifa_cp_gbm, variables = selected_variables) Finally predict_diagnostics() function (see Section 13.6) is used to calculate local diagnostic plots. The generic plot() function visualizes these profiles for selected variables. id_rf &lt;- predict_diagnostics(fifa_rf_exp, fifa[&quot;R. Lewandowski&quot;,], neighbors = 30) 21.7.3 Code snippets for Python In this chapter we will show Python snippets for instance-level exploration for the gradient boosting model. Other models were audited in a similar way. The predict_parts method from the dalex library (see Sections 7.7, 9.6) is used to calculate feature importance via feature permutations. The plot() method visualizes these statistics. fifa_mp_gbm = fifa_gbm.predict_parts() fifa_mp_gbm.plot(max_vars = 20) The predict_profile method from the dalex library (see Section ??) is used to calculate ceteris paribus profiles. The plot() method visualizes these profiles for selected variables. fifa_mp_gbm &lt;- fifa_gbm.predict_profile(type = &#39;break_down&#39;) fifa_mp_gbm.plot(variables = [&#39;Reactions&#39;, &#39;BallControl&#39;, &#39;Dribbling&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;]) 21.7.4 CR7 As a second example, we present explanations for the random-forest-model’s prediction for Cristiano Ronaldo (CR7). Below we list his characteristics, as included in the analyzed dataset. Note that Cristiano Ronaldo, as Robert Lewandowski, is also a striker. It might be thus of interest to compare the characteristics contributing to the model’s predictions for the two players. variable value variable value variable value variable value Age 33 Dribbling 88 ShotPower 95 Composure 95 Preferred.Foot 2 Curve 81 Jumping 95 Marking 28 International.Reputation 5 FKAccuracy 76 Stamina 88 StandingTackle 31 Weak.Foot 4 LongPassing 77 Strength 79 SlidingTackle 23 Skill.Moves 5 BallControl 94 LongShots 93 GKDiving 7 Crossing 84 Acceleration 89 Aggression 63 GKHandling 11 Finishing 94 SprintSpeed 91 Interceptions 29 GKKicking 15 HeadingAccuracy 89 Agility 87 Positioning 95 GKPositioning 14 ShortPassing 81 Reactions 96 Vision 82 GKReflexes 11 Volleys 87 Balance 70 Penalties 85 LogValue 8 The BD plot is presented in Figure 21.13. It suggests that the explanatory variables with the largest effect are ShotPower, LongShots, Volleys, and Vision. Figure 21.13: Break-down plot for Cristiano Ronaldo for the random-forest model. Figure 21.14 presents Shapley values for Cristiano Ronaldo. It indicates that the four explanatory variables with the largest values are Reactions, Dribbling, BallControl, and ShortPassing. These are the same variables as for Robert Lewandowski, though in a different order. Interestingly, the plot for Cristiano Ronaldo includes variable Age, for which Shapley value is negative. It suggests that CR7’s age has got a negative effect on the model’s prediction. Figure 21.14: Shapley values for Cristiano Ronaldo for the random-forest model. Finally, Figure 21.15 presents CP profiles for four selected explanatory variables for Cristiano Ronaldo. Figure 21.15: Ceteris-paribus profiles for Cristiano Ronaldo for four selected variables and the random-forest model. The profiles are similar to those presented in Figure 21.10 for Robert Lewandowski. An interesting difference is that, for Age, the predicted value for Cristiano Ronaldo is located within the region of age linked with a sharp drop in player’s value. This is in accordance with the observation, made based on Figure 21.14, that CR7’s age has got a negative effect on the model’s prediction. 21.7.5 Wojciech Szczęsny One might be interested in the characteristics influencing the random-forest model’s predictions for players other than strikers. To address the question, we present explanations for Wojciech Szczęsny, a goalkeeper. Below we list his characteristics, as included in the analyzed dataset. variable value variable value variable value variable value Age 28 Dribbling 11 ShotPower 15 Composure 65 Preferred.Foot 2 Curve 16 Jumping 71 Marking 20 International.Reputation 3 FKAccuracy 14 Stamina 45 StandingTackle 13 Weak.Foot 3 LongPassing 36 Strength 65 SlidingTackle 12 Skill.Moves 1 BallControl 22 LongShots 14 GKDiving 85 Crossing 12 Acceleration 51 Aggression 40 GKHandling 81 Finishing 12 SprintSpeed 47 Interceptions 15 GKKicking 71 HeadingAccuracy 16 Agility 55 Positioning 14 GKPositioning 85 ShortPassing 32 Reactions 82 Vision 48 GKReflexes 87 Volleys 14 Balance 51 Penalties 18 LogValue 8 Figure 21.16 shows the BD plot for the random-forest model. We can see that the most important contributions come from the explanatory variables related to goalkeeping skills like GKPositioning, GKHandling, and GKReflexes. Interestingly, field-player skills like BallControl or Dribbling have a negative effect. Figure 21.16: Break-down plot for Wojciech Szczęsny for the random-forest model. Figure 21.17 presents Shapley values (over 25 random orderings of explanatory variables) for the random-forest model. The plot confirms that the most important contributions to the prediction for Wojciech Szczęsny are due to goalkeping skills like GKDiving, GKPositioning, GKReflexes, and GKHandling. Interestingly, Reactions is also important, as it was the case for Robert Lewandowski (see Figure 21.9) and Cristiano Ronaldo (see Figure 21.14). Figure 21.17: Shapley values for Wojciech Szczęsny for the random-forest model. 21.7.6 Lionel Messi This instance might be THE choice for some of the readers. However, we have decided to leave explanation of the models’ predictions in this case as an exercise to the interested readers. References "],

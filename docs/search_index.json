As an example, consider prediction of sales based on historical data, prediction of risk of heart disease based on patient’s characteristics, or prediction of political attitudes based on Facebook comments. Predictive models have been constructed through the whole human history. Ancient Egyptians, for instance, used observations of rising of Sirius to predict flooding of the Nile. A more rigorous approach to model construction may be attributed to the method of least squares, published more than two centuries ago by Legendre in 1805 and by Gauss in 1809. With time, the number of applications in economy, medicine, biology,and agriculture was growing. The term regression was coined by Francis Galton in 1886. Initially, it was referring to biological applications, while today it is used for various models that allow prediction of continuous variables. Prediction of nominal variables is called classification, and its beginning may be attributed to works of Ronald Fisher in 1936. During the last century, many statistical models that can be used for predictive purposes have been developed. These include linear models, generalized linear models, regression and classification trees, rule-based models, and many others. Developments in mathematical foundations of predictive models were boosted by increasing computational power of personal computers and availability of large datasets in the era of ,,big data’’ that we have entered. With the increasing demand for predictive models, model features such as flexibility, ability to perform internally some feature engineering, and high precision of predictions are of interest. To obtain robust models, ensembles of models are used. Techniques like bagging, boosting, or model stacking combine hundreds or thousands of small models into a one super-model. Large deep neural models have over a bilion of parameters. There is a cost of this progress. Complex models may seem to operate like ,,black boxes’‘. It may be difficult, or even impopssible, to understand how thousands of coefficients affect the model prediction. At the same time, complex models may not work as good as we would like them to do. An overview of real problems with large black-box models may be found in an excellent book of Cathy O’Neil (O’Neil 2016) or in her TED Talk ,,The era of blind faith in big data must end’’. There is a growing number of examples of predictive models with performance that deteriorated over time or became biased in some sense. See, for instance, the issues related to the flu epidemic predictions by the Google Flu Trends model [Lazer et al Science 2014] or the problems with cancer recommndations based on the IBM Watson model [https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/05/watson-ibm-cancer/]. Today the true bottleneck in predictive modelling is not the lack of data, nor the lack of computational power, nor the lack of flexible models. It is the lack of tools for model validation, model exploration, and explanation of model decisions. Thus, in this book, we present a collection of methods that may be used for this purpose. As development of such methods is a very active area of research and new methods become available almost on a continuous basis, we do not aim at being exhaustive. Rather, we present the mind-set, key problems, and several examples of methods that can be used in model exploration. Lack of interpretability often leads to harmful situations. Models are not working properly and are hard to debug. For example, very famous Watson for Oncology was criticized by oncologists for delivering unsafe and inaccurate recommendations (Ross and Swetliz 2018). Results are biased in a systematic ways. For example, Amazon (giant in AI) failed with system for CV screening, as it was biased against woman (Dastin 2018). Or the COMPAS algorithm for predicting recidivism discriminates against race (Larson et al. 2016). These are serious violations of fairness and ethical principles. Data drift leads to the deterioration in models performance. For example, very popular model Google Flu after two years gave worse predictions than a baseline (Salzberg 2014). The number of such examples grows rapidly. A reaction for some of these these problems are new legal regulations, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2018) and the ,,Right to Explanation’’, a civic right to be given an explanation for an output of the automated algorithm (Goodman and Flaxman 2016). Some are already in use while new are being suggested (Casey, Farhangi, and Vogl 2018), (Ruiz 2018). It is an important topic and surprisingly, we still do not have good enough tools for verification, exploration and explanation of machine learning models. 1.2 A bit of philosophy: three laws of model explanation Seventy-six years ago Isaac Asimov forumlated Three Laws of Robotics: 1) a robot may not injure a human being, 2) a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, and 3) a robot must protect its own existence. Today’s robots, like cleaning robots, robotic pets, or autonomous cars are far from being conscious enough to be under Asimov’s ethics. However, we are more and more surrounded by complex predictive models and algoritmhs used for decision making. Machine learning models are used in health care, politics, education, justice, and many other areas. The models and algorithms have far larger influence on our lives than physical robots. Yet, applications of such models are left unregulated despite examples of their potential harmfulness. See Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil (O’Neil 2016) for an excellent overview of selected problems. It’s clear that some we need to control the models and algorithms that may affect us. Thus, Asimov’s laws are referred to in the context of the discussion around Ethics of Artifical Intelligence. Initiatives to formulate principles for the AI development have been undertaken, for instance, in the UK [Olhede &amp; Wolfe, Significance 2018, 15: 6-7]. Following Asimov’s approach, we could propose three requirements that any predictive model should fulfill: Prediction’s justification. For every prediction of a model, one should be able to understand which variables affect the prediction and to which extent. Prediction’s speculation. For every prediction of a model, one should be able to understand how the model prediction would change if input variables changed. Prediction’s validation For every prediction of a model, one should be able to verify how strong is the evidence that confirms this particular prediction. We see two ways to comply with these requirements. One is to use only models that fulfill these conditions by design. However, a reduction in performance may be the price for transparency. Another is to use tools that allow, perhaps by using approximations, to ,,explain’’ predictions for any model. In our book, we will focus on the latter. 1.3 Terminology It is worth noting that, when it comes to predictive models, the same concepts have often been given different names in statistics and in machine learning. For instance, in the statistical-modelling literature, one refers to ,,explanatory variables,’’ with ,,independent variables,’’ ,,predictors,’’ or ,,covariates’’ as often-used equivalents. Explanatory variables are used in the model as means to explain (predict) the ,,dependent variable,’’ also called ,,predicted’’ variable or ,,response.’’ In the machine-learning language, ,,input variables’’ or ,,features’’ are used to predict the ,,output’’ variable. In statistical modelling, models are fit to the data that contain ,,observations,’’ whereas in the machine-learning world a dataset may contain ,,instances.’’ To the extent possible, in our book we try to consistently use the statistical-modelling terminology. However, the reader may expect references to a ,,feature’’ here and there. Somewhat inconsistently, we also introduce the term ,,instance-level’’ explanation. Instance-level explanation methods are designed to extract information about the behavior of the model related to a specific observation or instance. On the other hand, ,,global’’ explanation techniques allow obtaining information about the behavior of the model for an entire dataset. We consider models for dependent variables that can be continuous or nominal. The values of a continuous variable can be represented by numbers with an ordering that makes some sense (zip codes or phone numbers are not considered as continuous variables). A continuous variable does not have to be continuous in the mathematical sense; counts (number of floors, steps, etc.) will be treated as continuous variables as well. A nominal variable can assume only a finite set of values that cannot be given numeric values. In this book we focus on ,,black-box’’ models. We discuss them in a bit more detail in the next section. 1.4 White-box models vs. black-box models Black-box models are models with a complex structure that is hard to understand by humans. Usually this refers to a large number of model coefficients. As humans may vary in their capacity of understanding complex models, there is no strict threshold for the number of coefficients that makes a model a black-box. In practice, for most humans this threshold is probably closer to 10 than to 100. A ,,white-box’’ model, which is opposite to a ,,black-box’’ one, is a model that is easy to understand by a human (though maybe not by every human). It has got a simple structure and a limited number of coefficients. The two most common classess of white-box models are decision or regression trees (see an example in Figure ??) or models with an additive structure, like the following model for mortality risk in melanoma patients: \\[ RelativeRisk = 1 + 3.6 * [Breslow &gt; 2] - 2 * [TILs &gt; 0] \\] In the model, two explanatory variables are used: an indicator whether the thickness of the lesion according to the Breslow scale is larger than 2 mm and an indicator whether the percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was larger than 0. The structure of a white box-model is, in general, easy to understand. It may be difficult to collect the necessary data, build the model, fit it to the data, and/or perform model validation, but once the model has been developed its interpretation and mode of working is straightforward. Why is it important to understand the model structure? There are several important advantages. If the model structure is clear, we can easily see which variables are included in the model and which are not. Hence, we may be able to, for instance, question the model when a particular explanatory variable was excluded from it. Also, in case of a model with a clear structure and a limited number of coefficients, we can easily link changes in model predictions with changes in particular explanatory variables. This, in turn, may allow us to challenge the model against the domain knowledge if, for instance, the effect of a particular variable on predictions is inconsistent with the previously established results. Note that linking changes in model predictions with changes in particular explanatory variables may be difficult when there are may variables and/or coefficients in the model. For instance, a classification tree with hundreds of nodes is difficult to understand, as is a linear regression model with hundreds of cofficients. Getting the idea about the performance of a black-box model may be more challenging. The structure of a complex model like, e.g., a neural-network model, mmay be far from transparent. Consequently, we may not understand which features and how influence the model decisions. Consequently, it may be difficult to decide whether the model is consistent with the domain knowledge. In our book we present tools that can help in extracting the information necessary for the model evaluation for complex models. 1.5 Model visualization, exploration, and explanation The lifecycle of a model can be divided, in general, in three different phases: development (or building), deployment, and maintenance. Model development is the phase in which one is looking for the best available model. During this process, model exploration tools are useful. Exploration involves evaluation of the fit of the model, verification of the assumptions underlying the model (diagnostics), and assessment of the predictive performance of the model (validation). In our book we will focus on the visualization tools that can be useful in model exploration. We will not, however, discuss visualization methods for diagnostic purposes, as they are extensively discussed in many books devoted to statistical modelling. Model deployment is the phase in which a predictive model is adopted for use. In this phase it is crucial that the users gain confidence in using the model. It is worth noting that the users might not have been involved in the model development. Moreover, they may only have got access to the software implementing the model that may not provide any insight in the details of the model structure. In this situation, model explanation tools can help to understand the factors that influence model predictions and to gain confidence in the model. The tools are one of the main focu point of our book. Finally, a deployed model requires maintenance. In this phase, one monitors model’s performance by, for instance, checking the validity of predictions for different datasets. If issues are detected, model explanation tools may be used to find the source of the problem and to suggest a modification of the structure of the model. 1.6 Model-agnostic vs. model-specific approach Some classes of models have been developed for a long period of time or have attracted a lot of interest with an intensive research as a result. Consequently, those classes of models are equipped with very good tools for model exploration or visualisation. For example: There are many tools for diagnostics and evaluation of linear models. Model assumptions are formally defined (normality, linear structure, homogenous variance) and can be checked by using normality tests or plots (normal qq-plot), diagnostic plots, tests for model structure, tools for identification of outliers, etc. For many more advanced models with an additive structure, like the proportional hazards model, there also many tools that can be used for checking model assumptions. Random-forest model is equipped with the out-of-bag method of evaluation of performance and several tools for measuring variable importance (Breiman et al. 2018). Methods have been developed to extract information from the model structure about possible interactions (Paluszynska and Biecek 2017b). Similar tools have been developed for other ensembles of trees, like xgboost models (Foster 2018). Neural networks enjoy a large collection of dedicated model-explanation tools that use, for instance, the layer-wise relevance propagation technique (Bach et al. 2015), or saliency maps technique (Simonyan, Vedaldi, and Zisserman 2013), or a mixed approach. Of course, the list of model classes with dedicated collections of model-explanation and/or diagnostics methods is much longer. This variety of model-specific approaches does lead to issues, though. For instance, one cannot easily compare explanations for two models with different structures. Also, every time when a new architecture or a new ensemble of models is proposed, one needs to look for new methods of model exploration. Finally, for brand-new models no tools for model explanation or diagnostics may be immedaitely available. For these reasons, in our book we focus on model-agnostic techniques. In particular, we prefer not to assume anything about the model structure, as we may be dealing with a black-box model with an unclear structure. In that case, the only operation that we may be able to perform is evaluation of a model for a selected observation. However, while we do not assume anything about the structure of the model, we will assume that the model operates on \\(p\\)-dimensional vectors and, for a single vector, it returns a single value which is a real number. This assumption holds for a broad range of models for data such as tabular data, images, text data, videos, etc. It may not be suitable for, e.g., models with memory in which the model output does not depend only on the model input [TOMASZ: NOT SURE WHICH MODELS ARE MEANT HERE]. Note that the techniques considered in the book may not be sufficient to fully understand models in case \\(p\\) is large. 1.7 Code snippets TODO: Here we should tell why we present examples for DALEX. And mention that there are also other functions that can be used. 1.8 The structure of the book Our book is split in two parts. In the part Instance-level explainers, we present techniques for exploration and explanation of model predictions for a single observation. On the other hand, in the part Global explainers, we present techniques for exploration and explanation of model’s performance for an entire dataset. In each part, every method is described in a separate section that has got the same structure: * Subsection Introduction explains the goal of and the general idea behind the method. * Subsection The Algorithm shows mathematical or computational details related to the method. This subsection can be skipped if you are not interested in the details. * Subsection Example shows an exemplary application of the method with discussion of results. * Subsection Pros and Cons summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the method. It also provides some guideance regarding when to use the method. * Subsection Code snippets shows the implementation of the method in R and Python. This subsection can be skipped if you are not interested in the implementation. TO DO: A SHORT REVIEW OF THE CONTENTS OF VARIOUS CHAPTERS Finally, we would like to signal that, in this book, we do show how to determine features that affect model prediction for a single observation. In particular, we present the theory and examples of methods that can be used to explain prediction like break down plots, ceteris paribus profiles, local-model approximations, or Shapley values. techniques to examine fully-trained machine-learning models as a whole. In particular, we review the theory and examples of methods that can be used to explain model performance globally, like partial-dependency plots, variable-importance plots, and others. charts that can be used to present key information in a quick way. tools and methods for model comparison. code snippets for R and Python that explain how to use the described methods. On the other hand, in this book, we do not focus on any specific model. The presented techniques are model agnostic and do not make any assumptions related to model structure. data exploration. There are very good books on this topic, like R for Data Science http://r4ds.had.co.nz/ or TODO the process of model building. There are also very good books on this topic, see An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ or TODO any particular tools for model building. These are discussed, for instance, in Applied Predictive Modeling By Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/ 1.9 Acknowledgements Przemek’s work on interpretability has started during research trips within the RENOIR project (691152 - H2020/2016-2019).

Over 1500 people died as a consequence of collision with an iceberg. Thanks to projects like Encyclopedia titanica https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/ we have a very rich and precise data about passengers. This dataset is available in the stablelearner package. After some variable transformation it is also avaliable in the DALEX package. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) head(titanic, 2) ## gender age class embarked country fare sibsp parch survived ## 1 male 42 3rd Southampton United States 7.11 0 0 no ## 2 male 13 3rd Southampton United States 20.05 0 2 no 2.1.1 Data cleaning Feature of interest is the binary variable survived. Let’s build some predictive models for this variable. First we need to do some data preprocessing. Columns with missing data are filled up # missing country is replaced by &quot;X&quot; titanic$country[is.na(titanic$country)] = &quot;X&quot; # missing age is replaced by average (30) titanic$age[is.na(titanic$age)] = 30 # missing fare, sibsp, parch are replaced by 0 titanic$fare[is.na(titanic$fare)] = 0 titanic$sibsp[is.na(titanic$sibsp)] = 0 titanic$parch[is.na(titanic$parch)] = 0 2.1.2 Data exploration It is always a good idea to do data exploration before modelling. But since this book is focused on model exploration we will spend only a few lines on data exploration part. And we will limit ourselves to two-variable summaries for each variable. 2.1.3 Logistic regression is always a good choice The feature of interest survival is binary, thus a natural choice is a logistic regression. Most of predictive features are categorical except age. There is no reason to expect a linear relation between age and odds of survival, thus for age we will use linear tail-restricted cubic splines available in the rcs() function in the rms package (Harrell Jr 2018). library(&quot;rms&quot;) titanic_lmr_v6 &lt;- lrm(survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ gender + rcs(age) + class + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, titanic) titanic_lmr_v6 ## Logistic Regression Model ## ## lrm(formula = survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ gender + rcs(age) + class + ## sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic) ## ## Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim. ## Ratio Test Indexes Indexes ## Obs 2207 LR chi2 752.73 R2 0.404 C 0.817 ## FALSE 1496 d.f. 17 g 1.648 Dxy 0.635 ## TRUE 711 Pr(&gt; chi2) &lt;0.0001 gr 5.195 gamma 0.636 ## max |deriv| 0.0001 gp 0.282 tau-a 0.277 ## Brier 0.146 ## ## Coef S.E.

Random forest is known for good performance, is able to grasp low-level variable interactions and is quite stable. Here we are using the randomForest package (Liaw and Wiener 2002). library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) titanic_rf_v6 &lt;- randomForest(survived ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic) titanic_rf_v6 ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = survived ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic) ## Type of random forest: classification ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 2 ## ## OOB estimate of error rate: 18.8% ## Confusion matrix: ## no yes class.error ## no 1398 98 0.06550802 ## yes 317 394 0.44585091 And a smaller model titanic_rf_v3 &lt;- randomForest(survived ~ class + gender + age, data = titanic) titanic_rf_v3 ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = survived ~ class + gender + age, data = titanic) ## Type of random forest: classification ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 1 ## ## OOB estimate of error rate: 20.89% ## Confusion matrix: ## no yes class.error ## no 1350 146 0.09759358 ## yes 315 396 0.44303797 2.1.5 Gradient boosting for interactions Last model that we will train on this dataset is the gradient boosting model. This family of models is known for being able to grasp deep interactions between variables. Here we are using the implementation from the gbm package (Ridgeway 2017). library(&quot;gbm&quot;) titanic_gbm_v6 &lt;- gbm(survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic, n.trees = 15000) ## Distribution not specified, assuming bernoulli ... titanic_gbm_v6 ## gbm(formula = survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + ## parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic, n.trees = 15000) ## A gradient boosted model with bernoulli loss function. ## 15000 iterations were performed. ## There were 7 predictors of which 7 had non-zero influence. 2.1.6 Model predictions Having all three models let’s see what are odds of surviving for a 2-years old boy that travels in the 3rd class with 1 parent and 3 siblings. henry &lt;- data.frame( class = factor(&quot;2nd&quot;, levels = c(&quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;deck crew&quot;, &quot;engineering crew&quot;, &quot;restaurant staff&quot;, &quot;victualling crew&quot;)), gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;)), age = 8, sibsp = 0, parch = 0, fare = 72, embarked = factor(&quot;Belfast&quot;, levels = c(&quot;Belfast&quot;,&quot;Cherbourg&quot;,&quot;Queenstown&quot;,&quot;Southampton&quot;)) ) Logistic regression model says 47% for survival. predict(titanic_lmr_v6, henry, type = &quot;fitted&quot;) ## 1 ## 0.4702145 Random forest model says 39% for survival. predict(titanic_rf_v6, henry, type = &quot;prob&quot;) ## no yes ## 1 0.66 0.34 ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;votes&quot; Gradient boosting model says 43.6% for survival. predict(titanic_gbm_v6, henry, type = &quot;response&quot;, n.trees = 15000) ## [1] 0.4382819 Three different opinions. Which one should we trust? Tools introduced in following sections will help to understand how these models are different. 2.2 Apartment Prices Warsaw skyscrapers by Artur Malinowski Flicker Predicting house prices is a common regression problem for machine learning. Various datasets for house prices are available at websites like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository. In this book we will work with a very interesting version of this problem. The apartments dataset is an artificial dataset created to match key characteristics of real apartments in Warsaw. But the dataset is created in a way that two very different models, namely linear regression and random forest, have almost exactly the same accuracy. Which one we should chose? Based on this dataset we show that visual explainers give a better understanding of key model characteristics and are very helpful in the model selection. The dataset is available in the DALEX package (Biecek 2018b). Each row corresponds to a single apartment. Features like surface, number of rooms, district or floor are used as predictive features. The problem here is to predict price per a square meter for an apartment, so it’s a regression problem with continuous target. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) head(apartments, 2) ## m2.price construction.year surface floor no.rooms district ## 1 5897 1953 25 3 1 Srodmiescie ## 2 1818 1992 143 9 5 Bielany head(apartments_test, 2) ## m2.price construction.year surface floor no.rooms district ## 1001 4644 1976 131 3 5 Srodmiescie ## 1002 3082 1978 112 9 4 Mokotow 2.2.1 A tale of two models Feature of interest is the variable m2.price, it’s a price (EUR) for a square meter of an apartment. Let’s build two predictive models for this variable. For the champion we will use a linear model. Easy to train, easy to test, easy to understand. apartments_lm_v5 &lt;- lm(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments) predicted_apartments_lm &lt;- predict(apartments_lm_v5, apartments_test) rmsd_lm &lt;- sqrt(mean((predicted_apartments_lm - apartments_test$m2.price)^2)) rmsd_lm ## [1] 283.0865 The root mean square difference for linear model calculated on test data is 283.1. Now, let’s train a challenger - a random forest model from randomForest package (Breiman et al. 2018). Elastic, popular, able to handle non linear relations. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) set.seed(72) apartments_rf_v5 &lt;- randomForest(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments) predicted_apartments_rf &lt;- predict(apartments_rf_v5, apartments_test) rmsd_rf &lt;- sqrt(mean((predicted_apartments_rf - apartments_test$m2.price)^2)) rmsd_rf ## [1] 282.9519 The root mean square difference for random forest is 283. The challenger is better in terms of RMSD, but the difference between accuracies is smaller than 10 cents. Shall we choose the model complex but elastic model or the linear model? 2.3 Hire or Fire In this chapter we present an artificial dataset from Human Resources department in a Call Center. The dataset is available in the DALEX package (Biecek 2018b). Each row corresponds to a single employee in a call center. Features like gender, age, average number of working hours per week, grade from the last evaluation and level of salary are used as predictive features. The goal here is to first build a model, that will guess when to fire and when to promote an employer, so it’s a classification problem with three classes. Why we need such model? We want to have objective decisions. That will not be subject to personal preferences of a manager. But is it possible to have an objective model? Would it be fair or it will just replicate some unfairness? We will use this example to show how to use prediction level explainers to better understand how the model works for selected cases. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) head(HR) ## gender age hours evaluation salary status ## 1 male 32.58267 41.88626 3 1 fired ## 2 female 41.21104 36.34339 2 5 fired ## 3 male 37.70516 36.81718 3 0 fired ## 4 female 30.06051 38.96032 3 2 fired ## 5 male 21.10283 62.15464 5 3 promoted ## 6 male 40.11812 69.53973 2 0 fired In this book we are focused on model exploration rather than model building, thus for sake ok simplicity we will use two default models created with random forest (Breiman et al. 2018) and generalized linear model (Ripley 2016). set.seed(59) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) HR_rf_v5 &lt;- randomForest(status ~ gender + age + hours + evaluation + salary, data = HR) library(&quot;nnet&quot;) HR_glm_v5 &lt;- multinom(status ~ gender + age + hours + evaluation + salary, data = HR) ## # weights: 21 (12 variable) ## initial value 8620.810629 ## iter 10 value 7002.127738 ## iter 20 value 6239.478146 ## iter 20 value 6239.478126 ## iter 20 value 6239.478124 ## final value 6239.478124 ## converged 2.4 List of Models In previous sections we build a collection of predictive models for dataset about Sinking of RMS Titanic, apartment prices and Human Resources data.

["PredictionExplainers.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction", " Chapter 3 Introduction Instance-level explainers help to understand how a model yields a prediction for a single observation. We can think about the following situations as examples: We may want to evaluate the effects of explanatory variables on model predictions. For instance, we may be interested in predicting the risk of heart attack based on person’s age, sex, and smoking habits. A model may be used to construct a score (for instance, a linear combination of the explanatory variables representing age, sex, and smoking habits) that could be used for the purposes of prediction. For a particular patient We may want to learn how much the different variables contribute to the patient’s score? We may want to understand how models predictions would change if values of some of the explanatory variables changed. For instance, what would be the predicted risk of heart attack if the patient cut the number of cigarettes smoked per day by half? We may discover that the model is providing incorrect predictions and we may want to find the reason. For instance, a patient with a very low risk-score experiences heart attack. What has driven that prediction? A model is a function with a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector \\(x\\) as an argument. The plot of the value(s) of the function can be constructed in a \\(p+1\\)-dimensional space. An example with \\(p=2\\) is presented in Figure 3.1. We will use it as an illustration of key ideas. The plot provides an information about the values of the function in the vicinity of point \\(x^*\\). Figure 3.1: (fig:cutsSurfaceReady) Response surface for a model that is a function of two variables. We are interested in understanding the response of a model in a single point x* There are many different tools that may be used to explore the predictions of the model around a single point \\(x^*\\). In the following sections we will describe the most popular approaches. They can be divided into three classes. One approach is to investigate how the model prediction changes if the value of a single explanatory variable changes. It is useful in the so-called ,,What-If’’ scenarios. In particular, we can construct plots presenting the change of model-based predictions in function of a single variable. Such plots are usually called Ceteris Paribus profiles. They are presented in Chapter 4. An example is provided in panel A of Figure 3.2. Another approach is to analyze the curvature of the response surface (see Figure 3.1) around the point of interest \\(x^*\\). Treating the model as a function, we are interested in the local behavior of this function around \\(x^*\\). In case of a black-box model, we approximate it with a simpler white-box model around \\(x^*\\). An example is provided in panel B of Figure 3.2. In Chapter 11 we present the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method that exploits the concept of a ,,local model.’’ Yet another approach is to analyze how the model prediction for point \\(x^*\\) is different from the average model prediction and how the difference can be distributed among the different dimensions (explanatory variables). It is often called the ,,variable attributions’’ approach. An example is provided in panel C of Figure 3.2. In Chapter 7 we present two methods implementing this approach, sequential conditioning and average conditioning (also called Shapley values). Figure 3.2: (fig:cutsTechnikiReady) Illustration of different approaches to instance-level explanation. Panel A presents a What-If analysis with Ceteris Paribus profiles. The profiles plot the model response as a function of a value of a single variable, while keeping the values of all other explanatory variables fixed. Panel B illustrates the concept of local models. A simpler white-box model is fitted around the point of interest. It describes the local behaviour of the black-box model. Panel C illustrates the concept of variable attributions. Additive effects of each variable show how the model response differs from the average. "],
["ceterisParibus.html", "Chapter 4 Ceteris Paribus Profiles - a tool for What-If analysis 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Intuition 4.3 Method 4.4 Pros and cons 4.5 Code snippets for R", " Chapter 4 Ceteris Paribus Profiles - a tool for What-If analysis 4.1 Introduction Ceteris paribus is a Latin phrase meaning “other things held constant” or “all else unchanged.” In this chapter, we introduce a technique for model exploration based on the Ceteris paribus principle. In particular, we examine the influence of each explanatory variable, asumming that effects of all other variables are unchanged. The main goal is to understand how changes in a single explanatory variable affects model predictions. Explainers presented in this chaprter are linked to the second law introduced in Section 1.2, i.e. the law of “Prediction’s speculation.” This is why the tools are also known as What-If model analysis or Individual Conditional EXpectations (Goldstein et al. 2015a). It turns out that it is easier to understand how a black-box model is working if we can explore the model by investigating the influence of explanatory variables separately, changing one at a time. 4.2 Intuition Panel A of Figure 4.1 presents a response surface for a titanic_lmr_v6 model for two explanatory variables, age and class, from the titanic dataset (see Section 2.1). We are interested in the change of the model prediction induced by each of the variables. Toward this end, we may want to explore the curvature of the response surface around a single point that is marked on the plot by a black dot. Ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles are one-dimensional profiles that examine the curvature across each dimension, i.e., for each variable. Panel B of Figure 4.1 presents the profiles corresponding to age and class. In essence, a CP profile shows a conditional expectation of the dependent variable (response) for the particular explanatory variable. Figure 4.1: (fig:modelResponseCurveLine) A) Model response (prediction) surface. Ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles marked with black curves help to understand the curvature of the surface while changing only a single explanatory variable. B) CP profiles for individual variables, age (continuous) and class (categorical). CP technique is similar to the LIME method (see Section 11). LIME and CP profiles examine the curvature of a model response-surface. The difference between these two methods lies in the fact that LIME approximates the black-box model of interest locally with a simpler white-box model. Usually, the LIME model is sparse, i.e., contains fewer variables, and thus we have got to graphically investigate a smaller number of dimensions. On the other hand, the CP profiles present conditional predictions for every variable and, in most cases, are easier to intepret. 4.3 Method In this section we introduce more formally uni-dimensional CP profiles. [PBI: Do we need to assume that model is correct? first sentence may be removed] Assume that \\(E_Y(Y | x^*) \\approx f(x^*)\\), where \\(f(x^*)\\) is the value of the model at \\(x^*\\). Note that \\(x^*\\) is a vector containing values for explanatory covariates. We will use subscript \\(x^*_i\\) to refer to the vector corresponding to the \\(i\\)-th observation in a dataset. We will use superscript \\(x^{*j}\\) to refer to the \\(j\\)-th element of \\(x^*\\), i.e., the \\(j\\)-th variable. Additionally, let \\(x^{*-j}\\) denote a vector resultinig from removing the \\(j\\)-th element from vector \\(x^{*}\\). Moreover, let \\(x^{*|j}=z\\) denotes a vector in which the \\(j\\)-th element is equal to \\(z\\) (a scalar). We define a one-dimensional CP profile for the model \\(f()\\), \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable, and point \\(x^*\\) as follows: \\[ CP^{f, j, x^*}(z) \\equiv f(x^{*|j} = z). \\] That is, CP profile is a function that provides the dependence of the (approximate) expected value (prediction) of the model for \\(Y\\) on the value of \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable \\(z\\), where \\(z\\) is taken to go through the range of values typical for the variable and values of all other variables in \\(x^*\\) are kept fixed at the values present in \\(x^*\\). For continuous explanatory variables a natural way to represent the CP function is to use a profile plot similar to the one presented in Figure 4.2. In the figure, the dot presents an instance prediction, i.e., prediction \\(f(x^*)\\) for a single observation \\(x^*\\). The curve shows how the prediction would change if the value of a particular explanatory variable is changed (in this case, “age”; see Section 2.3). It is worth oberving that the profile for logistic regression is smooth while for random forest model is expresses some variabilit. Moreover, for this instance (observation), the prediction would increase substantially if the value of the explanatory variable became lower than 20. Figure 4.2: (fig:profileAgeRf) Ceteris-Paribus profile for two models, titanic_lmr_v6 and titanic_rf_v6 that predicts the probability of being rescued as a function of the age For categorical explanatory variables a natural way to represent the CP function is to use barplot as the one presented in Figure 4.3. Figure 4.3: (fig:profileAgeRf2) Ceteris-Paribus profile for two models, titanic_lmr_v6 and titanic_rf_v6 that predicts the probability of being rescued as a function of the class Usually, black-box models contain a large number of explanatory variables. However, CP profiles are legible even for tiny subplots, created with techniques like sparklines or small multiples (Tufte 1986). In this way we can display a large number of profiles at the same time keeping profiles for consecutive variables in separate panels, as shown in Figure 4.4. It helps if these panels are ordered so that the most important profiles are listed first. We discuss a method to assess importance of CP profiles in the next subsection. Figure 4.4: (fig:profileV4Rf) Ceteris-paribus profiles for all continuous explanatory variables in the titanic' dataset for thetitanic_rf_v6` model 4.4 Pros and cons CP profiles offer a uniform, easy to comunicate and extendable approach to model exploration. Their graphical representation is easy to understand and explain. It is possible to show profiles for many variables or models in a single plot. There are several issues related to the use of the CP profiles. If explanatory variables are correlated, then changing one variable implies a change in the other. In such case, the application of the Ceteris paribus principle may lead to unrealistic settings, as it is not possible to keep one variable fixed while changing the other one. A special case are interactions, which require the use of 2D CP profiles that are more complex than the 1D ones. Also, in case of a model with hundreds or thousands of variables, the number of plots to inspect may be daunting. Finally, visualization of CP profiles for factors (categorical explanatory variables) is not trivial, especially for factors with many nominal (unordered) categories (like, for example, a ZIP-code). 4.5 Code snippets for R In this section we present key features of the R package ingredients (Biecek 2019) which is a part of DALEXverse and covers all methods presented in this chapter. More details and examples can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/ingredients/. There are also other R packages that offer similar functionality, like condvis (O’Connell, Hurley, and Domijan 2017), pdp (Greenwell 2017a), ICEbox (Goldstein et al. 2015b), ALEPlot (Apley 2018a), iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018a). In this section we use a random forest (Breiman et al. 2018) model titanic_rf_v6 developed for the Titanic dataset (see Section 2.1). In particular, we deal with a binary classification problem - we want to predict the probability of survival for a selected passenger. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) titanic &lt;- na.omit(titanic) head(titanic, 2) ## gender age class embarked country fare sibsp parch survived ## 1 male 42 3rd Southampton United States 7.11 0 0 no ## 2 male 13 3rd Southampton United States 20.05 0 2 no ## age_c ## 1 (30,50] ## 2 (10,18] library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) model_titanic_rf &lt;- randomForest(survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ gender + age + class + embarked + fare + sibsp + parch, data = titanic) CP profiles are calculated in four steps with the ingredients package. 1. Create an explainer - wrapper around model and validation data. Model-objects created with different libraries may have different internal structures. Thus, first, we have got to create a wrapper around the model. Toward this end we use the explain() function from the DALEX package (Biecek 2018b). The function requires five arguments: model a model-object, data a validation data frame, y observed values of the dependent variable for the validation data, predict_function a function that returns prediction scores, if not specified, then a default predict() function is used. label a function that returns prediction scores, if not specified then it is extracted from the class(model). In the example below we use the training data as the validation dataset. explain_titanic_rf &lt;- explain(model = model_titanic_rf, data = titanic[,-9], y = titanic$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest v7&quot;) 2. Define the instance (observation) of interest. CP profiles explore model around a single observation. Thus, in the exampe below, we define data frame johny_d with a single row. It describes an 8-years old boy that travels in the first class without parents and siblings. Then, we obtain the model prediction for this instance with the help of the `predict()’ function. In particular, we compute the probability for each category of the dependent binary variable. johny_d &lt;- data.frame( class = factor(&quot;1st&quot;, levels = c(&quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;deck crew&quot;, &quot;engineering crew&quot;, &quot;restaurant staff&quot;, &quot;victualling crew&quot;)), gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;)), age = 8, sibsp = 0, parch = 0, fare = 72, embarked = factor(&quot;Southampton&quot;, levels = c(&quot;Belfast&quot;, &quot;Cherbourg&quot;, &quot;Queenstown&quot;, &quot;Southampton&quot;)) ) predict(explain_titanic_rf, johny_d) ## 1 ## 0.4511397 3. Calculate CP profiles To obtain CP profiles, we use the ceteris_paribus() function. It requires the explainer-object and the instance data frame as arguments. By default, CP profiles are calculated for all numerical variables. To select a subset of variables, the variables argument can be used. As a result, the function yields an object od the class ceteris_paribus_explainer. It is a data frame with model predictions. library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) cp_titanic_rf &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_titanic_rf, johny_d, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;, &quot;class&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;)) cp_titanic_rf ## Top profiles : ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked _yhat_ _vname_ ## 1 1st male 0.1666667 0 0 72 Southampton 0.4845677 age ## 1.1 1st male 2.0000000 0 0 72 Southampton 0.4888091 age ## 1.2 1st male 4.0000000 0 0 72 Southampton 0.4832353 age ## 1.3 1st male 7.0000000 0 0 72 Southampton 0.4531397 age ## 1.4 1st male 10.0000000 0 0 72 Southampton 0.4179202 age ## 1.5 1st male 14.0000000 0 0 72 Southampton 0.2901186 age ## _ids_ _label_ ## 1 1 Random Forest v7 ## 1.1 1 Random Forest v7 ## 1.2 1 Random Forest v7 ## 1.3 1 Random Forest v7 ## 1.4 1 Random Forest v7 ## 1.5 1 Random Forest v7 ## ## ## Top observations: ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked _yhat_ _label_ ## 1 1st male 8 0 0 72 Southampton 0.4511397 Random Forest v7 ## _ids_ ## 1 1 4. Plot CP profiles. To obtain a graphical represenation of CP profiles, the generic plot() function can be applied to the data frame returend by the ceteris_paribus() function. It returns a ggplot2 object that can be processed if needed. The resulting plot can be enriched with additional data by adding functions show_rugs (adds rugs for the selected points), show_observations (adds observations), or show_aggreagated_profiles (see Section @ref{variableEngeneering}). All these functions can take additional arguments to modify size, color or linetype. plot(cp_titanic_rf) + show_observations(cp_titanic_rf, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris Paribus Profiles&quot;, &quot;For the random forest model and titanic dataset&quot;) References "],

To prioritize between profiles we need a measure that would summarize the impact of a selected variable on model’s predictions. We will propose now a solution closely linked with CP profiles, but the issue is also discussed also in the next chapter. 5.2 Intuition To assign importance to CP profiles, we can use the concept of profile oscillations. In particular, the larger influence of an explanatory variable on prediction at a particular instance, the larger the fluctuations along the corresponding CP profile. For a variable that exercises little or no influence on model prediction, the profile will be flat or will barely change. Figure 5.1 illustrates the idea behind measuring oscillations. The larger the highlighted area, the more important is the variable. Figure 5.1: (fig:CPVIPprofiles) The value of the red are area summarizes CP oscillations and provides the average absolute deviations between the CP profile and the instance prediction. This example is for the titanic_lmer_v6 model and the titanic dataset Figure 5.2 provides a plot of variable importance measures for different variables for the titanic_lmer_v6 and the titanic dataset. The wider the interval, the larger the CP-profile oscillations for a particular explanatory variable. Thus, Figure 5.2 indicates that the most important variable for prediction for a selected observation is age, followed by sibsp. Figure 5.2: (fig:CPVIP1) Variable-importance measures calculated for Ceteris-paribus oscillations for observation ID: 31. This example is for the titanic_lmer_v6 model and the titanic dataset 5.3 Method Let us formalize this concept now. Denote by \\(g^j(z)\\) the probability density function of the distribution of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. The summary measure of the variable’s importance for model prediction at point \\(x\\), \\(vip^{CP}_j(x)\\), computed based on the variable’s CP profile, is defined as follows: \\[ vip^{CP}_j(x^*) = \\int_{\\mathcal R} |CP^{f,j,x^*}(z) - f(x^*)| g^j(z)dz=E_{X_j}[|CP^{f,j,x^*}(X_j) - f(x^*)|]. \\] Thus, \\(vip^{CP}_j(x^*)\\) is the expected absolute deviation of the CP profile from the model prediction for \\(x^*\\) over the distribution of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. A straightforward estimator of \\(vip^{CP}_j(x^*)\\) is \\[ \\widehat{ vip^{CP}_j(x^*)} = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n |CP^{f,j,x^*}(x^{*j}_i) - f(x^*)|, \\] where index \\(i\\) goes through all observations in a dataset. Note that the importance of an explanatory variable for instance prediction may be very different for different points \\(x^*\\). For example, consider model \\[ f(x_1, x_2) = x_1 * x_2, \\] where \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) take values in \\([0,1]\\). Consider prediction for an observation described by vector \\(x^* = (0,1)\\). In that case, the importance of \\(X_1\\) is larger than \\(X_2\\). This is because the CP profile for the first variable, given by the values of function \\(f(z,1)=z\\), will have oscillations, while the profile for the second variable will show no oscillation, because it is given by function \\(f(0,z)=0\\). Obviously, the situation is reversed for \\(x^*=(1,0)\\). 5.4 Pros and cons By using oscillations of Ceteris Paribus profiles it is possible to select the most important variables for a single instance. The methodology is easy to extend to two or more variables. Oscillations are easy to interpret. There are several issues related to the use of the CP oscillations. Two most serious are: if two variables are correlated, then Ceteris Paribus profiles may be misleading as they do not take correlations into account. local feature importance do not sum up to model prediction. In next sections we will introduce variable attribution measures that eliminate this problem. 5.5 Code snippets for R In this section we present key features of the R package ingredients (Biecek 2019) which is a part of DALEXverse and covers all methods presented in this chapter. More details and examples can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/ingredients/.

Let us use the johny_d instance again. johny_d &lt;- data.frame( class = factor(&quot;1st&quot;, levels = c(&quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;deck crew&quot;, &quot;engineering crew&quot;, &quot;restaurant staff&quot;, &quot;victualling crew&quot;)), gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;)), age = 8, sibsp = 0, parch = 0, fare = 72, embarked = factor(&quot;Southampton&quot;, levels = c(&quot;Belfast&quot;, &quot;Cherbourg&quot;, &quot;Queenstown&quot;, &quot;Southampton&quot;)) ) Profiles are calculated with the ceteris_paribus() function. library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) cp_titanic_rf &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_titanic_rf, johny_d, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;, &quot;sibsp&quot;, &quot;parch&quot;)) plot(cp_titanic_rf) + show_observations(cp_titanic_rf, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;, &quot;sibsp&quot;, &quot;parch&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris Paribus Profiles&quot;, &quot;For the random forest model and titanic dataset&quot;) For selected profiles we can calculate oscillations with the calculate_oscillations function. cpo_titanic_rf &lt;- calculate_oscillations(cp_titanic_rf) cp_titanic_rf$`_ids_` = &quot;Johny D&quot; cpo_titanic_rf ## _vname_ _ids_ oscillations ## 1 age 1 0.21864350 ## 4 parch 1 0.16324640 ## 2 fare 1 0.07473998 ## 3 sibsp 1 0.02951691 The calculate_oscillations() function returns an object of the class ceteris_paribus_oscillations, which has a form of a data frame but has also overloaded plot() function. Use it to plot local variable importance for a selected observation plot(cpo_titanic_rf) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris Paribus Oscillations&quot;, &quot;For model_titanic_rf model&quot;) It looks like for Jony D. the two most important features are age and parch. Higher age of this passenger would significantly lower the chances of survival while higher parch would increase these odds. References "],

Also, the definition of the variance importance measure \\(vip^{CP}_j(x^*)\\) have a straightforward extension for a larger number of variables. For instance, a two-dimensional (2D) CP profile for model \\(f\\), explanatory variables \\(j\\) and \\(k\\), and point \\(x^*\\) is defined as follows: \\[ CP^{f, (j,k), x^*}(z_1, z_2) \\equiv f(x^*|^{(j,k)} = (z_1,z_2)). \\] Thus, 2D CP profile is a function that provides the dependence of the (approximate) expected value (prediction) of the model for \\(Y\\) on the values of \\(j\\)-th and \\(k\\)-th explanatory variables \\(z_1\\) and \\(z_2\\), respectively, where \\(z_1\\) and \\(z_2\\) are taken to go through the range of values typical for the variables, and values of all other variables in \\(x^*\\) are kept fixed at the values present in \\(x^*\\). The corresponding variance importance measure would be defined as follows: \\[ vip^{CP}_{j,k}(x^*) = \\int_{\\mathcal R}\\int_{\\mathcal R} |CP^{f,(j,k),x^*}(z_1,z_2) - f(x^*)| g^{j,k}(z_1,z_2)dz_1dz_2=E_{X_j,X_k}[|CP^{f,j,x^*}(X_j,X_k) - f(x^*)|], \\] where the expected value is taken over the joint distribution of the \\(j\\)-th and \\(k\\)-th explanatory variable. Such multi-dimensional extensions are useful to check if, for instance, the model involves interactions. In particular, presence of pairwise interactions may be detected with two-dimensional (2D) CP profiles. A natural way to visualise 2D CP profiles is to use a heatmap, as in Figure 6.1.

Figure 6.2: (fig:CP2Dall) Ceteris-paribus profile for all pairs of explanatory variables for a model for the price of an apartment. If the number of pairs is large, we can use the variable importance measure to order the pairs based on their importance and select the most important pairs for purposes of illustration. 6.1 Example: Local Model Fidelity It may happen that global performance of the model is good, while for some particular observations the fit is very bad. Local fidelity helps to understand how good is the model fit at a particular observation. In this section we show how to use CP profiles to validate local model fidelity. The idea behind fidelity plots is to select a number of observatons (“neighbors”) from the validation dataset that are closest to the observation of interest. Then for the selected observations we plot CP profiles and check how stable they are. Additionally, if we know true values of the dependent variable for the selected neighbours, we may add residuals to the plot to evaluate the local fit of the model. An example of a fidelity plot is presented in Figure 6.3. [TOMASZ: WHICH DATA? WHICH MODEL? WHICH OBSERVATION WAS SELECTED? HOW THE NEIGHBORS WERE SELECTED?] The dark black line shows the CP profile for the observation of interest. Grey lines show CP profiles for the neihgbors. The red intervals indicate the residuals, i.e., the difference between the model prediction and the observed value of the dependent variable (indicated by the red dot). [TOMASZ: WHY ARE THERE INTERVALS THAT DO NOT START AT THE CP PROFILE?] In this example the intervals show that the predicted values are larger than the observed values of the dependent variable for all neighbors, i.e., all residuals are negative. Thus, the model may provide biased predictions around the observation of interest. [TOMASZ: IF WE FOCUS ON THE RESIDUALS, WHY DO WE NEED THE PROFILES?] Figure 6.3: (fig:CPfidelity1) Local fidelity plot [TOMASZ: WHICH DATA? WHICH OBSERVATION? WHICH MODEL?]. The black line shows the Cetris-paribus (CP) profile for the observation of interest. Grey lines show CP profiles for the neighbors of the observation from a validation dataset. Red intervals correspond to residuals - each interval extends from the model prediction for a selected neighbor to the observed value of the dependent variable (indicated by the red dot). This observation is confirmed by Figure 6.4, which compares the distribution of all residuals from the validation dataset and the distribution of residuals for the neighbors. The plot shows that the residuals for neighbors are shifted towards higher values. [TOMASZ: THIS MAKES NO SENSE. THE PLOT SUGGESTS POSITIVE RESIDUALS, WHEREAS ABOVE IT IS ARGUED THAT THE RESIDUALS ARE NEGATIVE.] This suggests that the model predictions around the observation of interest are biased. Figure 6.4: (fig:CPfidelityBoxplot) Distribution of residuals for the entire validation dataset (grey boxplot) and for 15 selected neighbors to the observation of interest (red boxplot). 6.2 Pros and cons CP profiles offer a uniform, easy to comunicate and extendable approach to model exploration. Their graphical representation is easy to understand and explain. It is possible to present profiles for many variables or models in a single plot. By using the expected oscillations of CP profiles it is possible to select the most important variables for instane prediction. Two-dimensional CP profiles can be used to, for instance, identify the presence of pairwise interactions in a model. There are several issues related to the use of the CP profiles. If explanatory variables are correlated, then changing one variable implies a change in the other. In such case, the application of the Ceteris paribus principle may lead to unrealistic settings, as it is not possible to keep one variable fixed while changing the other one. A special case are interactions, which require the use of 2D CP profiles that are more complex than the 1D ones. Also, in case of a model with hundreds or thousands of variables, the number of plots to inspect may be daunting. Finally, visualization of CP profiles for factors (categorical explanatory variables) is not trivial, especially for factors with many nominal (unordered) categories (like, for example, a ZIP-code). 6.3 Code snippets for R In this section we present key features of the R package ingredients (???) which is a part of DALEXverse and covers all methods presented in this chapter. More details and examples can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/ingredients/. There are also other R packages that offer similar methods. For example, an interesting approach to model exploration based on similar principles [TOMASZ: CETERIS-PARIBUS? IF NOT, WHY MENTION IT HERE?] is implemented in the condvis package (O’Connell, Hurley, and Domijan 2017). In this section we use a random forest (Breiman et al. 2018) model model_titanic_rf developed for the Titanic dataset (see Section @ref{model_titanic_rf}). In particular, we deal with a binary classification problem - we want to predict the probability of survival for a selected passenger. CP profiles are calculated in four steps with the ingredients package. 1. Create an explainer - wrapper around model and validation data. Model-objects created with different libraries may have different internal structures. Thus, first, we have got to create a wrapper around the model. Toward this end we use the explain() function from the DALEX package (Biecek 2018b). The function requires at least four arguments: a model-object, a validation data frame, observed values of the dependent variable for the validation data, and a function that returns prediction scores. In the example below we use the training data as the validation dataset. Moreover, we do not specify the fourth argument, because the prediction-score function for randomForest objects is pre-implemented. [TOMASZ: SO, THE STATEMENT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF FOUR ARGUMENTS IS NOT PRECISE.] library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) explainer_titanic_rf &lt;- explain(model_titanic_rf, data = titanic_small, y = titanic_small$Survived) 2. Define the instance (observation) of interest. CP profiles explore model around a single observation. Thus, in the exampe below, we define data frame johny_d with a single row. It describes an 8-years old boy that travels in the first class without parents and siblings. Then, we obtain the model prediction for this instance with the help of the `predict()’ function. In particular, we compute the probability for each category of the dependent binary variable. johny_d &lt;- data.frame( Pclass = 1, Sex = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;)), Age = 8, SibSp = 0, Parch = 0, Fare = 72, Embarked = factor(&quot;C&quot;, levels = c(&quot;N&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;,&quot;S&quot;)) ) predict(model_titanic_rf, johny_d, type = &quot;prob&quot;) ## 0 1 ## 1 0.442 0.558 ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;votes&quot; 3. Calculate CP profiles To obtain CP profiles, we use the ceteris_paribus() function. It requires the explainer-object and the instance data frame as arguments. By default, CP profiles are calculated for all numerical variables. To select a subset of variables, the variables argument can be used. As a result, the function yields a data frame with model predictions around the instance of interest. [TOMASZ: WHAT IS THE DEFAULT OUTPUT WHEN PRINTING THE RESULTING DATA FRAME?] devtools::install_github(&quot;ModelOriented/ingredients&quot;) library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) cp_titanic_rf &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explainer_titanic_rf, johny_d, variables = c(&quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Fare&quot;, &quot;Pclass&quot;, &quot;SibSp&quot;)) cp_titanic_rf ## Top profiles : ## Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare Embarked _yhat_ _vname_ _ids_ ## 1 1 male 0.42 0 0 72 C 0.612 Age 1 ## 1.1 1 male 1.00 0 0 72 C 0.602 Age 1 ## 1.2 1 male 2.00 0 0 72 C 0.586 Age 1 ## 1.3 1 male 3.00 0 0 72 C 0.596 Age 1 ## 1.4 1 male 4.00 0 0 72 C 0.592 Age 1 ## 1.5 1 male 5.00 0 0 72 C 0.592 Age 1 ## _label_ ## 1 randomForest ## 1.1 randomForest ## 1.2 randomForest ## 1.3 randomForest ## 1.4 randomForest ## 1.5 randomForest ## ## ## Top observations: ## Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare Embarked _yhat_ _label_ _ids_ ## 1 1 male 8 0 0 72 C 0.558 randomForest 1 4. Plot CP profiles. To obtain a graphical represenation of CP profiles, the generic plot() function can be applied to the data frame returend by the ceteris_paribus() function. It returns a ggplot2 object that can be processed if needed. The resulting plot can be enriched with additional data by adding functions show_rugs (adds rugs for the selected points), show_observations (adds observations), or show_aggreagated_profiles (see Section @ref{variableEngeneering}). All these functions can take additional arguments to modify size, color or linetype. plot(cp_titanic_rf) + show_observations(cp_titanic_rf, variables = c(&quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Fare&quot;, &quot;Pclass&quot;, &quot;SibSp&quot;)) A very useful feature of the CP profiles is that profiles for two or more models may be superimposed in a single plot. Such an approach is sometimes called “contrastive explanations” and is very helpful for model comparisons. We will illustrate this approach by comparing the profiles for the random forest model with those obtained for a logistic regression model (see Section @ref{model_titanic_lmr}). library(&quot;rms&quot;) model_titanic_lmr &lt;- lrm(Survived == &quot;1&quot; ~ Pclass + Sex + rcs(Age) + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked, titanic_small) explainer_titanic_lmr &lt;- explain(model_titanic_lmr, data = titanic_small, y = titanic_small$Survived, predict_function = function(m,x) predict(m,x,type = &quot;fitted&quot;)) cp_titanic_lmr &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explainer_titanic_lmr, johny_d, variables = c(&quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Fare&quot;, &quot;Pclass&quot;, &quot;SibSp&quot;)) cp_titanic_lmr ## Top profiles : ## Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare Embarked _yhat_ _vname_ _ids_ ## 1 1 male 0.42 0 0 72 C 0.9784112 Age 1 ## 1.1 1 male 1.00 0 0 72 C 0.9752918 Age 1 ## 1.2 1 male 2.00 0 0 72 C 0.9688533 Age 1 ## 1.3 1 male 3.00 0 0 72 C 0.9608045 Age 1 ## 1.4 1 male 4.00 0 0 72 C 0.9507814 Age 1 ## 1.5 1 male 5.00 0 0 72 C 0.9383767 Age 1 ## _label_ ## 1 glm ## 1.1 glm ## 1.2 glm ## 1.3 glm ## 1.4 glm ## 1.5 glm ## ## ## Top observations: ## Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare Embarked _yhat_ _label_ _ids_ ## 1 1 male 8 0 0 72 C 0.8836101 glm 1 After obtaining the CP profiles for the logistic regression model, we can use function plot() to compare profiles for both models in a single chart. Toward this aim, we use both data frames as arguments for the function. The additional argument color = &quot;_label_&quot; sets color as a key for model. plot(cp_titanic_rf, cp_titanic_lmr, color = &quot;_label_&quot;) + show_observations(cp_titanic_rf, cp_titanic_lmr, variables = c(&quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Fare&quot;, &quot;Pclass&quot;, &quot;SibSp&quot;)) [TOMASZ: WE SHOULD PROVIDE COMMENTS FOR THE RESULTING PLOT.] Oscillations To calculate the variable importance measures based on the oscillations of CP profiles, we use the calculate_oscillations() function. We apply the function to the data frame returned by the ceteris_paribus() function. The result for the prediction of the Random Forest model for johny_d indicates that the most important variable is the age. To obtain a graphical representaton of the result, we can apply function plot() to the object returned by the calculate_oscillations() function. co_titanic_rf &lt;- calculate_oscillations(cp_titanic_rf) co_titanic_rf ## _vname_ _ids_ oscillations ## 1 Age 1 0.11517460 ## 2 Fare 1 0.06140000 ## 3 Pclass 1 0.04300000 ## 4 SibSp 1 0.03771429 plot(co_titanic_rf) Two-dimensional Ceteris-paribus Profiles To create 2D CP profiles, we use the ceteris_paribus_2d() function.

["variableAttributionMethods.html", "Chapter 7 Variable attribution for linear models 7.1 Introduction 7.2 Intuition 7.3 Method 7.4 Example: Wine quality 7.5 Pros and Cons 7.6 Code snippets", " Chapter 7 Variable attribution for linear models 7.1 Introduction In this chapter we introduce the concept and the intuitions underlying ‘’variable attribution,’’ i.e., the decomposition of the difference between the single-instance and the average model predictions among the different explanatory variables. We can think about the following examples: Assume that we are interested in predicting the risk of heart attack based on person’s age, sex, and smoking habits. A patient may want to know which factors have the highest impact on the his/her risk score. Consider a model for prediction of apartment prices. An investor may want to know how much of the predicted price may be attributed to, for instance, the location of an apartment. Consider a model for credit scoring. A customer may want to know if factors like gender, age, or number of children influence model predictions. In each of those cases we want to attribute a part of the model prediction to a single explanatory variable. This can be done directly for linear models. Hence, in this chapter We focus on those models. The method can be easily extended to generalized linear models. Model-agnostic approaches will be presented in Chapters 8 and 10. 7.2 Intuition Assume a classical linear model for response \\(Y\\) with \\(p\\) explanatory variables collected in the vector \\(X = (X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p)\\) and coefficients \\(\\beta = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, .., \\beta_p)\\), where \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept. The prediction for \\(Y\\) at point \\(X=x=(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_p)\\) is given by the expected value of \\(Y\\) conditional on \\(X=x\\). For a linear model, the expected value is given by the following linear combination: \\[ E_Y(Y | x) = f(x) = \\beta_0 + x_1 \\beta_1 + \\ldots + x_p \\beta_p. \\] We are interested in the contribution of the \\(i\\)-th explanatory variable to model prediction \\(f(x^*)\\) for a single observation described by \\(x^*\\). In this case, the contribution is equal to \\(x^*_i\\beta_i\\), because the \\(i\\)-th variable occurs only in this term. As it will become clear in the sequel, it is easier to interpret the variable’s contribution if \\(x_i\\) is is centered by subtracting a constant \\(\\hat x_i\\) (usually, the mean of \\(x_i\\)). This leads the following, intuitive formula for the variable attribution: \\[ v(f, x^*, i) = \\beta_i (x_i^* - \\hat x_i). \\] 7.3 Method We want to calculate \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\), which is the contribution of the \\(i\\)-th explanatory variable to the prediction of model \\(f()\\) at point \\(x^*\\). Assume that \\(E_Y(Y | x^*) \\approx f(x^*)\\), where \\(f(x^*)\\) is the value of the model at \\(x^*\\). A possible approach to define \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) is to measure how much the expected model response changes after conditioning on \\(x_i^*\\): \\[ v(f, x^*, i) = E_Y(Y | x^*) - E_{X_i}\\{E_Y[Y | (x_1^*,\\ldots,x_{i-1}^*,X_i,x_{i+1}^*,x_p^*)]\\}\\approx f(x^*) - E_{X_i}[f(x_{-i}^*)], \\] where \\(x_{-i}^*\\) indicates that variable \\(X_i\\) in vector \\(x_{-i}^*\\) is treated as random. For the classical linear model, if the explanatory variables are independent, \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) can be expressed as follows: \\[ v(f, x^*, i) = f(x^*) - E_{X_i}[f(x_{-i}^*)] = \\beta_0 + x_1^* \\beta_1 + \\ldots + x_p^* \\beta_p - E_{X_i}[\\beta_0 + x_1^* \\beta_1 + \\ldots +\\beta_i X_i \\ldots + x_p^* \\beta_p] = \\beta_i[x^*_i - E_{X_i}(X_i)]. \\] In practice, given a dataset, the expected value of \\(X_i\\) can be estimated by the sample mean \\(\\bar x_i\\). This leads to \\[ v(f, x^*, i) = \\beta_i (x^*_i - \\bar x_i). \\] Note that the linear-model-based prediction may be re-expressed in the following way: \\[ f(x^*) = [\\beta_0 + \\bar x_1 \\beta_1 + ... + \\bar x_p \\beta_p] + [(x_1^* - \\bar x_1) \\beta_1 + ... + (x_p^* - \\bar x_p) \\beta_p] \\equiv [average \\ prediction] + \\sum_{j=1}^p v(f, x^*, j). \\] Thus, the contributions of the explanatory variables are the differences between the model prediction for \\(x^*\\) and the average prediction. ** NOTE for careful readers ** Obviously, sample mean \\(\\bar x_i\\) is an estimator of the expected value \\(E_{X_i}(X_i)\\), calculated using a dataset. For the sake of simplicity we do not emphasize these differences in the notation. Also, we ignore the fact that, in practice, we never know the model coefficients and we work with an estimated model. Also, we assumed that the explanatory variables are independent, which may not be the case. We will return to this problem in Section [TOMASZ: INSERT REF], when we will discuss interactions. 7.4 Example: Wine quality Figure 7.1 shows the relation between alcohol and wine quality, based on the wine dataset (Cortez et al. 2009). The linear model is \\[ quality(alcohol) = 2.5820 + 0.3135 * alcohol. \\] The weakest wine in the dataset has 8% of alcohol, while the average alcohol concentration is 10.51%. Thus, the contribution of alcohol to the model prediction for the weakest wine is \\(0.3135 \\cdot (8-10.51) = -0.786885\\). This means that low concentration of alcohol for this wine (8%) decreses the predicted quality by \\(-0.786885\\). Note, that it would be misleading to use \\(x_i^*\\beta_i = 0.3135*8 = 2.508\\) as the alcohol contribution to the quality. The positive value of the product would not correrspond to the intuition that, in the presence of a positive relation, a smaller alcohol concentration should imply a lower quality of the wine. Figure 7.1: (fig:attribution1a)Relation between wine quality and concentration of alcohol assessed with linear model 7.5 Pros and Cons The proposed definition of \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) is linked neither with scale nor location of \\(X_i\\); hence, it is easier to understand than, for instance, the standardized value of \\(\\beta_i\\). [TOMASZ: I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ARGUMENT. THE DEFINITION OF v() INVOLVES CENTERING.] For the classical linear model, \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) is not an approximation and it is directly linked with the structure of a model. An obvious diasadvantage is that the definition of \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) is very much linear-model based. Also, it does not, in any way, reduce the model complexity; it only presents model coefficients in a different way. [TOMASZ: I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ARGUMENT. MODEL COMPLEXITY IS WHAT IT IS. HOW CAN WE REDUCE IT?] 7.6 Code snippets In this section, we present an example of computing variable attributions using the HR dataset (see Section 25.1 for more details). To calculate variable attributions for a particular point, first we have got to define this point: new_observation &lt;- data.frame(gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;)), age = 57.7, hours = 42.3, evaluation = 2, salary = 2) Variable attributions for linear and generalized linear models may be directly extracted by applying the predict() function, with the argument type = &quot;terms&quot;, to an object containing results of fitting of a model. To illustrate the approach for logistic regression, we build a logistic regression model for the binary variable status == &quot;fired&quot; and extract the estimated model coefficients: library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) model_fired &lt;- glm(status == &quot;fired&quot; ~ ., data = HR, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) coef(model_fired) ## (Intercept) gendermale age hours evaluation ## 5.737945729 -0.066803609 -0.001503314 -0.102021120 -0.425793369 ## salary ## -0.015740080 For the new observation, the predicted value of the logit of the probability of being fired is obtained by applying the predict() function: as.vector(pred.inst &lt;- predict(model_fired, new_observation)) # new pediction ## [1] 0.3858406 On the other hand, variable attributions can be obtained by applying the predict() function with the type=&quot;terms&quot; argument: (var.attr &lt;- predict(model_fired, new_observation, type = &quot;terms&quot;)) # attributions ## gender age hours evaluation salary ## 1 -0.03361889 -0.02660691 0.7555555 0.5547197 0.007287334 ## attr(,&quot;constant&quot;) ## [1] -0.8714962 The largest contributions to the prediction come from variables ‘’hours’’ and ‘’evaluation.’’ Variables ‘’gender’’ and ‘’age’’ slightly decrease the predicted value. The sum of the attributions is equal to sum(var.attr) ## [1] 1.257337 The attribute constant of object var.attr provides the ‘’average’’ prediction, i.e., the predicted logit for an obsrvation defined by the means of the explanatory variables, as can be seen from the calculation below: coef(model_fired)%*%c(1, mean((HR$gender==&quot;male&quot;)), mean(HR$age), mean(HR$hours), mean(HR$evaluation), mean(HR$salary)) ## [,1] ## [1,] -0.8714962 Adding the ‘’average’’ prediction to the sum of the variable attributions results in the new-observation prediction: attributes(var.attr)$constant + sum(var.attr) ## [1] 0.3858406 Below we illustrate how to implement this approach with the DALEX package. Toward this end, functions explain() and single_prediction() can be used. Object model_fired stores the definition of the logistic-regression model used earlier in this section. The contents of object attribution correspond to the results obtained by using function predict(). library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) explainer_fired &lt;- explain(model_fired, data = HR, y = HR$status == &quot;fired&quot;, label = &quot;fired&quot;) (attribution &lt;- single_prediction(explainer_fired, new_observation)) ## variable contribution variable_name variable_value ## 1 (Intercept) 0.363833312 Intercept 1 ## hours + hours = 42.3 0.109221944 hours 42.3 ## evaluation + evaluation = 2 0.134863451 evaluation 2 ## salary + salary = 2 0.001751398 salary 2 ## age + age = 57.7 -0.006343784 age 57.7 ## gender + gender = male -0.008045314 gender male ## 11 final_prognosis 0.595281007 ## cummulative sign position label ## 1 0.3638333 1 1 fired ## hours 0.4730553 1 2 fired ## evaluation 0.6079187 1 3 fired ## salary 0.6096701 1 4 fired ## age 0.6033263 -1 5 fired ## gender 0.5952810 -1 6 fired ## 11 0.5952810 X 7 fired After object attribution has been created, a plot presenting the variable attributions can be easily constructed: plot(attribution) References "],

This method is accurate, based directly on the structure of the model. But for most popular machine learning models we cannot assume that they are linear nor even additive. 8.1 Intuition For any model we may repeat the intuition presented in Section 7 to calculate variable contribution as shifts in expected model response after conditioning over consecutive variables. This intuition is presented in Figure ??. Panel A shows distribution of model responses. The row all data shows the model response of the original dataset. The red dot stands for average is is an estimate of expencted model response \\(E [f(x)]\\). Since we want to calculate effects of particular values of selected variables we then condition over these variables in a sequential manner. The next row in panel A corresponds to average model prediction for observations with variable surface fixed to value 35. The next for corresponds to average model prediction with variables surface set to 35 and floor set to 1, and so on. The top row corresponds to model response for \\(x^*\\). Black lines in the panel A show how prediction for a single point changes after coordinate \\(i\\) is repaced by the \\(x^*_i\\). But finaly we are not interestes in particular changes, not even in distributions but only in averages - expected model responses. The most minimal form that shows important information is presented in the panel C. Positive values are presented with green bars while negative differences are marked with yellow bar. They sum up to final model prediction, which is denoted by a grey bar in this example. Figure 8.1: (fig:BDPrice4) Break Down Plots show how variables move the model prediction from population average to the model prognosis for a single observation. A) The last row shows distribution of model predictions. Next rows show conditional distributions, every row a new variable is added to conditioning. The first row shows model prediction for a single point. Red dots stand for averages. B) Blue arrows shows how the average conditional response change, these values are variables contributions. C) Only variable contributions are presented. 8.2 Method Again, let \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) stands for the contribution of variable \\(x_i\\) on prediction of model \\(f()\\) in point \\(x^*\\). We expect that such contribution will sum up to the model prediction in a given point (property called local accuracy), so \\[ f(x^*) = baseline + \\sum_{i=1}^p v(f, x^*, i) \\] where \\(baseline\\) stands for average model response. Note that the equation above may be rewritten as \\[ E [f(X)|X_1 = x_1^*, \\ldots, X+p = x_p^*] = E[f(X)] + \\sum_{i=1}^p v(f, x^*, i) \\] what leads to quite natural proposition for \\(v(f, x^*_i, i)\\), such as \\[ v(f, x^*_i, i) = E [f(X) | X_1 = x_1^*, \\ldots, X_i = x_i^*] - E [f(X) | X_1 = x_1^*, \\ldots, X_{i-1} = x_{i-1}^*] \\] In other words the contribution of variable \\(i\\) is the difference between expected model response conditioned on first \\(i\\) variables minus the model response conditioned on first \\(i-1\\) variables. Such proposition fulfills the local accuracy condition, but unfortunatelly variable contributions depends on the ordering of variables. Figure 8.2: (fig:ordering) Two different paths between average model prediction and the model prediction for a selected observation. Black dots stand for conditional average, red arrows stands for changes between conditional averages. See for example Figure 8.2. In the first ordering the contribution of variable age is calculated as 0.01, while in the second the contribution is calculated as 0.13. Such differences are related to the lack of additivness of the model \\(f()\\). Propositions presented in next two sections present different solutions for this problem. The approach for variable attribution presented in the Section ?? has the property of local accuracy, but variable contributions depends on the variable ordering. The easiest way to solve this problem is to use two-step procedure. In the first step variables are ordered and in the second step the consecutive conditioning is applied to ordered variables. First step of this algorithm is to determine the order of variables for conditioning. It seems to be reasonable to include first variables that are likely to be most important, leaving the noise variables at the end. This leads to order based on following scores \\[ score(f, x^*, i) = \\left| E [f(X)] - E [f(X)|X_i = x^*_i] \\right| \\] Note, that the absolute value is needed as variable contributions can be both positive and negative. Once the ordering is determined in the second step variable contributions are calculated as \\[ v(f, x^*_i, i) = E [f(X) | X_{I \\cup \\{i\\}} = x_{I \\cup \\{i\\}}^*] - E [f(X) | X_{I} = x_{I}^*] \\] where \\(I\\) is the set of variables that have scores smaller than score for variable \\(i\\). \\[ I = \\{j: score(f, x^*, j) &lt; score(f, x^*, i)\\} \\] The time complexity of the first step id \\(O(p)\\) where \\(p\\) is the number of variables and the time complexity of the second step is also \\(O(p)\\). 8.3 Example: Hire or Fire? Let us consider a random forest model created for HR data. The average model response is \\(\\bar f(x) = 0.385586\\). For a selected observation \\(x^*\\) the table below presents scores for particular variables. Ei f(X) scorei hours 0.616200 0.230614 salary 0.225528 0.160058 evaluation 0.430994 0.045408 age 0.364258 0.021328 gender 0.391060 0.005474 Once we determine the order we can calculate sequential contributions variable cumulative contribution (Intercept) 0.385586 0.385586 * hours = 42 0.616200 0.230614 * salary = 2 0.400206 -0.215994 * evaluation = 2 0.405776 0.005570 * age = 58 0.497314 0.091538 * gender = male 0.778000 0.280686 final_prognosis 0.778000 0.778000 8.4 Pros and cons Break Down approach is model agnostic, can be applied to any predictive model that returns a single number. It leads to additive variable attribution. Below we summarize key strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Pros Break Down Plots are easy to understand and decipher. Break Down Plots are compact; many variables may be presented in a small space. Break Down Plots are model agnostic yet they reduce to intuitive interpretation for linear Gaussian and generalized models. Complexity of Break Down Algorithm is linear in respect to the number of variables. Cons If the model is non-additive then showing only additive contributions may be misleading. Selection of the ordering based on scores is subjective. Different orderings may lead to different contributions. For large number of variables the Break Down Plot may be messy with many variables having small contributions. 8.5 Code snippets for R In this section we present key features of the breakDown2 package for R (Biecek 2018a). This package covers all features presented in this chapter. It is available on CRAN and GitHub. Find more examples at the website of this package https://pbiecek.github.io/breakDown2/.

For non-additive models the variables contributions depend on values of other variables. In this section we present an algorithm that identifies interactions between pairs of variables and include such interactions in variable decomposition plots. Here we present an algorithm for pairs of variables, but it can be easily generalized to larger number of variables. 9.1 Intuition The key idea here is to identify interactions between variables. This can be done in two steps. First we determine variable contributions for each variable independently. Second, we calculate effect for pair of variables. If this effect is different than the sum of consecutive variables then it may be an interaction. TODO: easy example for interaction 9.2 Method This algorithm is also composed out of two steps. In the first step variables and pairs of variables are ordered in terms of their importance, while in the second step the consecutive conditioning is applied to ordered variables. To determine an importance of variables and pairs of variables following scores are being calculated. For a single variable \\[ score_1(f, x^*, i) = \\left| E [f(X)|X_i = x^*_i] - E [f(X)]\\right| \\] For pairs of variables \\[ score_2(f, x^*, (i,j)) = \\left| E [f(X)|X_i = x^*_i, X_j = x^*_j] - E [f(X)|X_i = x^*_i] - E [f(X)| X_j = x^*_j]+ E [f(X)] \\right| \\] Note that this is equivalent to \\[ score_2(f, x^*, (i,j)) = \\left| E [f(X)|X_i = x^*_i, X_j = x^*_j] - score_1 (f, x^*, i) - score_1 (f, x^*, j) + baseline \\right| \\] In other words the \\(score_1(f, x^*, i)\\) measures how much the average model response changes if variable \\(x_i\\) is set to \\(x_i^*\\), which is some index of local variable importance. On the other hand the \\(score_2(f, x^*, (i,j))\\) measures how much the change is different than additive composition of changes for \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\), which is some index of local interaction importance. Note, that for additive models \\(score_2(f, x^*, (i,j))\\) shall be close to zero. So the larger is this value the larger deviation from additivness. The second step of the algorithm is the sequential conditioning. In this version in every new step we condition on a single variable of pair of variables in an order determined by \\(score_1\\) and \\(score_2\\). The complexity of the first step id \\(O(p^2)\\) where \\(p\\) stands for the number of variables. The complexity of the second step is \\(O(p)\\). 9.3 Example: Hire or Fire? Again, let us consider a HR dataset. The table below shows \\(score_1\\) and \\(score_2\\) calculated for consecutive variables. Ei f(X) score1 score2 hours 0.616200 0.230614 salary 0.225528 -0.160058 age:gender 0.516392 0.146660 salary:age 0.266226 0.062026 salary:hours 0.400206 -0.055936 evaluation 0.430994 0.045408 hours:age 0.635662 0.040790 salary:evaluation 0.238126 -0.032810 age 0.364258 -0.021328 evaluation:hours 0.677798 0.016190 salary:gender 0.223292 -0.007710 evaluation:age 0.415688 0.006022 gender 0.391060 0.005474 hours:gender 0.626478 0.004804 evaluation:gender 0.433814 -0.002654 Once we determined the order, we can calculate sequential conditionings. In the first step we condition over variable hours, then over salary. The third position is occupied by interaction between age:gender thus we add both variables to the conditioning variable cumulative contribution (Intercept) 0.385586 0.385586 * hours = 42 0.616200 0.230614 * salary = 2 0.400206 -0.215994 * age:gender = 58:male 0.796856 0.396650 * evaluation = 2 0.778000 -0.018856 final_prognosis 0.778000 0.778000 9.4 Break Down Plots Break Down Plots for interactions are similar in structure as plots for single variables. The only difference is that in some rows pair of variable is listed in a single row. See an example in Figure ??. Figure 9.1: (fig:bdInter1) Break Down Plot for variable attrbution with interactions 9.5 Pros and cons Break Down for interactions shares many features of Break Down for single variables. Below we summarize unique strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Pros If interactions are present in the model, then additive contributions may be misleading. In such case the identification of interactions leads to better explanations. Complexity of Break Down Algorithm is quadratic, what is not that bad if number of features is small or moderate. Cons For large number of variables, the consideration of all interactions is both time consuming and sensitive to noise as the number of \\(score_2\\) scores grow faster than number of \\(score_1\\). 9.6 Code snippets for R The algorithm for Break Down for Interactions is also implemented in the local_interactions function from breakDown2 package.

In the Section 8 we show an approach in which the ordering was determined based on single step assessment of variable importance. In this section we introduce other, very popular approach for additive variable attribution. The problem of contributions that depends on the variable ordering is solved by averaging over all possible orderings. This method is motivated with results in cooperative game theory and was first introduced in (Štrumbelj and Kononenko 2014). Wide adoption of this method comes with a NIPS 2017 paper (Lundberg and Lee 2017) and python library SHAP https://github.com/slundberg/shap. Authors of the SHAP method introduced also efficient algorithm for tree-based models, see (Lundberg, Erion, and Lee 2018). 10.1 Intuition Since in sequential attribution effect depends on the ordering. Here the idea is to average across all possible orderings. TODO: a nice example 10.2 Method The name Shapley Values comes from the solution in cooperative game theory attributed to Lloyd Shapley. The original problem was to assess how important is each player to the overall cooperation, and what payoff can he or she reasonably expect from the coalition? (Shapley 1953) In the context of model interpretability the payoff is the average model response while the players are the variables in the conditioning. Then Formula for variable contributions is following. \\[ v(f, x^*, i) = \\frac 1{|P|}\\sum_{S \\subseteq P\\setminus \\{i\\}} {{|P|-1}\\choose{|S|}}^{-1} \\left(E [f(X) | X_{S \\cup \\{i\\}} = x^*_{S \\cup \\{i\\}}] - E [f(X) | X_{S} = x^*_{S}]\\right) \\] where \\(P = \\{1, \\ldots, p\\}\\) is the set of all variables. The intuition beyond this contribution is following. We consider all possible orderings of variables (yes, there is \\(2^p\\) of them) and calculate the contribution of variable \\(i\\) as an average from contributions calculated in particular orderings. The part \\(E[f(X) | X_{S \\cup \\{i\\}} = x^*_{S \\cup \\{i\\}}] - E [f(X) | X_{S} = x^*_{S}]\\) is the contribution of variable \\(i\\) which is introduces after variables from \\(S\\). Time complexity of this method is \\(O(2^p)\\) where \\(p\\) stands for the number of variables. Such complexity makes this method impractical for most cases. Fortunately it is enough to assess this value. (Štrumbelj and Kononenko 2014) proposed to use sampling. (Lundberg, Erion, and Lee 2018) proposed fast implementations for tree based ensembles. Properties Shaply values have (as a single unique solution) following properties Local accuracy. Sum of attributions is equal to the model response. \\[ f(x^*) = \\sum_{i} v(f, x^*, i) \\] Missingness, if simplified (add to notation) input is 0, then it’s impact is also 0 \\[ x_i^* = 0 implies v(f, x^*, i) = 0 \\] Consistency, if a new model \\(g\\) is larger for model \\(f\\) then it’s attributions are larger than attributions for \\(f\\). 10.3 Example: Hire or Fire? 10.4 Pros and cons Shapley Values give a uniform approach to decompose model prediction into parts that can be attributed additively to variables. Below we summarize key strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Pros There is a nice theory based on cooperative games. (Lundberg and Lee 2017) shows that this method unifies different approaches to additive features attribution, like DeepLIFT, Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation, LIME. There is efficient implementation available for Python. (Lundberg and Lee 2017) shows more desired properties of this method, like symmetry or additivity. Cons The exact calculation of Shapley values is time consuming. If the model is not additive, then the Shaply scores may be misleading. And there is no way to determine if model is far from additiveness. Note that fully additive model solutions presented in sections ??, 8 and 10 lead to same variable contributions. 10.5 Code snippets for R In this section we will present an example based on the HR dataset and Random Forest model (Breiman et al. 2018).

Models that easy to understand and are similar to black box model around the point of interest. Variable attribution methods, that were presented in the Section 8 are not interested in the local curvature of the model. They rather compare model prediction against average model prediction and they use probability structure of the dataset. The complementary approach would be to directly explore information about model curvature around point of interest. In the section 4 we introduced Ceteris Paribus tool for such what-if analysis. But the limitation of ceteris Paribus pltos is that they explore changes along single dimension or pairs of dimensions. In this section we describe an another approach based on local approximations with white-box models. This approach will also investigate local curvature of the model but indirectly, through surrogate white-box models. The most known method from this class if LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), introduced in the paper Why Should I Trust You?: Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016). This methods and it’s clones are now implemented in various R and python packages, see for example (Pedersen and Benesty 2018), (Staniak and Biecek 2018) or (Molnar 2018a). 11.1 Intuition 11.2 Method The LIME method, and its clones, has following properties: model-agnostic, they do not imply any assumptions on model structure, interpretable representation, model input is transformed into a feature space that is easier to understand. One of applications comes from image data, single pixels are not easy to interpret, thus the LIME method decompose image into a series of super pixels, that are easier to interpret to humans, local fidelity means that the explanations shall be locally well fitted to the black-box model. Therefore the objective is to find a local model \\(M^L\\) that approximates the black box model \\(f\\) in the point \\(x^*\\). As a solution the penalized loss function is used. The white-box model that is used for explanations satisfies following condition. \\[ M^*(x^*) = \\arg \\min_{g \\in G} L(f, g, \\Pi_{x^*}) + \\Omega (g) \\] where \\(G\\) is a family of white box models (e.g. linear models), \\(\\Pi_{x^*}\\) is neighbourhood of \\(x^*\\) and \\(\\Omega\\) stands for model complexity. Figure 11.1: (fig:LIME1) A schematic idea behind local model approximations. Panel A shows training data, colors correspond to classess. Panel B showhs results fom the Random Forest model, whis is where the algorithm starts. Panel C shows new data sampled around the point of interest. Their color correspond to model response. Panel D shows fitted linear model that approximated the random forest model around point of interest The algorithm is composed from three steps: Identification of interpretable data representations, Local sampling around the point of interest, Fitting a white box model in this neighbouhood Identification of interpretable data representations For image data, single pixel is not an interpretable feature. In this step the input space of the model is transformed to input space that is easier to understand for human. The image may be decomposed into parts and represented as presence/absence of some part of an image. Local sampling around the point of interest Once the interpretable data representation is identified, then the neighbourhood around point of interest needs to be explored. Fitting a white box model in this neighbouhood Any model that is easy to interpret may be fitted to this data, like decision tree or rule based system. However in practice the most common family of models are linear models. 11.3 Example: Hire or Fire? 11.4 Pros and cons Local approximations are model agnostic, can be applied to any predictive model. Below we summarize key strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Pros This method is highly adopted in text analysis and image analysis, in part thanks to the interpretable data representations. The intuition behind the model is straightforward Model explanations are sparse, thus only small number of features is used Cons For continuous variables and tabular data it is not that easy to find interpretable representations The black-box model approximated the data and the white box model approximates the black box model. We do not have control over the quality of local fit of the white box model, thus the surrogate model may be misleading. Due to the curse of dimensionality, for high dimensional space points are sparse. 11.5 Code snippets for R In this section we present example application of lime (Pedersen and Benesty 2018) and live (Staniak and Biecek 2018) packages. Note that this method is also implemented in iml (Molnar 2018a) and other packages. These pacakages differ in some details and also results in different explanations.

There are several use-cases for such explainers. Think about following. Model improvement. If model works particular bad for a selected observation (the residual is very high) then investigation of model responses for miss fitted points may give some hints how to improve the model. For individual predictions it is easier to notice that selected variable should have different a effect. Additional domain specific validation. Understanding which factors are important for model predictions helps to be critical about model response. If model contributions are against domain knowledge then we may be more skeptical and willing to try another model. On the other hand, if the model response is aligned with domain knowledge we may trust more in these responses. Such trust is important in decisions that may lead to serious consequences like predictive models in medicine. Model selection. Having multiple candidate models one may select the final response based on model explanations. Even if one model is better in terms of global model performance it may happen that locally other model is better fitted. This moves us towards model consultations that identify different options and allow human to select one of them.

This is the main difference from the instance level explainers that were focused on a model behaviour around a single observation. Model level explainers work in the context of a population or subpopulation. Think about following use-cases One wants to know which variables are important in the model. Think about model for heart accident in which features come from additional medical examinations. Knowing which examinations are not important one can reduce a model by removing unnecessary variables. One wants to understand how a selected variable affects the model response. Think about a model for prediction of apartment prices. You know that apartment location is an important factor, but which locations are better and how much a given location is worth? Model explainers help to understand how values of a selected variable affect the model response. One wants to know if there are any unusual observations that do not fit to the model. Observations with unusually large residuals. Think about a model for survival after some very risky treatment. You would like to know if for some patients the model predictions are extremely incorrect. All cases mentioned above are linked with either model diagnostic (checking if model behaves alog our expectations) or knowledge extraction (model was trained to extract some knowledge about the discipline). 13.1 Approaches to model explanations Model level explanations are focused on four main aspects of a model. Model performance. Here the question is how good is the model, is it good enough (better than some predefined threshold), is a model A better than model B? Variable importance. How important are variables, which are the most important and which are not important at all? Variable effects. What is the relation between a variable and model response, can the variable be transformed to create a better model? Model residuals. Is there any unusual pattern related to residuals, are they biased, are they correlated with some additional variable? 13.2 A bit of philosophy: Three Laws for Model Level Explanations In the spirit of three laws introduces in the chapter 1.2 here we propose three laws for model level explanations. Variable importance. For every model we shall be able to understand which variables are important and which are not. Model audit. For every model we shall be able to verify basic check like if residuals are correlated with variables and if there are unusual observations. Second opinion. For every model we shall be able to compare it against other models to verify if they capture different stories about the data. "],
["variableImportance.html", "Chapter 14 Feature Importance 14.1 Permutation Based Feature Importance 14.2 Example: Titanic 14.3 Example: Price prediction 14.4 More models 14.5 Level frequency", " Chapter 14 Feature Importance Methods presented in this chapter are useful for assessment of feature importance. There are many possible applications of such methods, for example: Feature importance scores may be used for feature filtering. Features that are not important may be removed from the model training procedure. Removal of the noise shall lead to better models. Identification of the most important features may be used as a validation of a model against domain knowledge. Just to make sure that it’s not like a single random feature dominates model predictions. Identification of the most important features may leads to new domain knowledge. Well, we have identified important features. Comparison of feature importance between different models helps to understand how different models handle particular features. Ranking of feature importance helps to decide in what order we shall perform further model exploration, in what order we shall examine particular feature effects. There are many methods for assessment of feature importance. In general we may divide them into two groups, methods that are model specific and methods that are model agnostic. Some models like random forest, gradient boosting, linear models and many others have their own ways to assess feature importance. Such method are linked with the particular structure of the model. In terms of linear models such specific measures are linked with normalized regression coefficients of p-values. For tree based ensembles such measures may be based on utilization of particular features in particular trees, see (Foster 2017) for gradient boosting or (Paluszynska and Biecek 2017a) for random forest. But in this book we are focused on methods that are model agnostic. The may reason for that is First, be able to apply this method to any predictive model or ensemble of models. Second, (which is maybe even more important) to be able to compare feature importance between models despite differences in their structure. Model agnostic methods cannot assume anything about the model structure and we do not want to refit a model. The method that is presented below is described in details in the (Fisher, Rudin, and Dominici 2018). The main idea is to measure how much the model fit will decrease if a selected feature or group of features will be cancelled out. Here cancellation means perturbations like resampling from empirical distribution of just permutation. The method can be used to measure importance of single features, pairs of features or larger tuples For the simplicity below we describe algorithm for single features, but it is straight forward to use it for larger subsets of features. 14.1 Permutation Based Feature Importance The idea behind is easy and in some sense borrowed from Random Forest (Breiman et al. 2018). If a feature is important then after permutation model performance shall drop. The larger drop the more important is the feature. Let’s describe this idea in a bit more formal way. Let \\(\\mathcal L(f(x), y)\\) be a loss function that assess goodness of fit for a model \\(f(x)\\) while let \\(\\mathcal X\\) be a set of features. For each feature \\(x_i \\in \\mathcal X\\) do steps 2-5 Create a new data \\(x^{*,-i}\\) with feature \\(x_i\\) resampled (or permutated). Calculate model predictions for the new data \\(x^{*,-i}\\), they will be denoted as \\(f(x^{*,-i})\\). Calculate loss function for models predictions on perturbed data \\[ L^{*,-i} = \\mathcal L(f(x^{*,-i}), y) \\] Feature importance may be calculated as difference or ratio of the original loss and loss on perturbed data, i.e. \\(vip(x_i) = L^{*,-i} - L\\) or \\(vip(x_i) = L^{*,-i} / L\\). Note that ranking of feature importance will be the same for the difference and the ratio since the loss \\(L\\) is the same. Note also, that the main advantage of the step 5 is that feature importance is kind of normalized. But in many cases such normalization is not needed and in fact it makes more sense to present raw \\(L^{*,-i}\\) values. 14.2 Example: Titanic Let’s use this approach to a random forest model created for the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict passenger survival probability based on their sex, age, class, fare and some other features available in the titanic dataset. head(titanic) ## gender age class embarked country fare sibsp parch survived ## 1 male 42 3rd Southampton United States 7.11 0 0 no ## 2 male 13 3rd Southampton United States 20.05 0 2 no ## 3 male 16 3rd Southampton United States 20.05 1 1 no ## 4 female 39 3rd Southampton England 20.05 1 1 yes ## 5 female 16 3rd Southampton Norway 7.13 0 0 yes ## 6 male 25 3rd Southampton United States 7.13 0 0 yes ## age_c ## 1 (30,50] ## 2 (10,18] ## 3 (10,18] ## 4 (30,50] ## 5 (10,18] ## 6 (18,30] Permutation based feature importance can be calculated with the feature_importance{ingredients}. By default it permutes values feature by feature. Instead of showing normalized feature importance we plot both original \\(L\\) and loss after permutation \\(L^{*,-i}\\). This way we can read also how good was the model, and as we will see in next subsection it will be useful for model comparison. library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) fi_rf &lt;- feature_importance(explain_titanic_rf) plot(fi_rf) + ggtitle(&quot;Permutation based feature importance&quot;, &quot;For Random Forest model and Titanic data&quot;) Figure 14.1: Feature importance. Each interval presents the difference between original model performance (left end) and the performance on a dataset with a single feature perturbed It’s interesting that the most important variable for Titanic data is the Sex. So it have been ,,women first’’ after all. Then the three features of similar importance are passenger class (first class has higher survival), age (kids have higher survival) and fare (owners of more pricy tickets have higher survival). Note that drawing permutations evolves some randomness. Thus to have higher repeatability of results you may either set a seed for random number generator or replicate the procedure few times. The second approach has additional advantage, that you will learn the uncertainty behind feature importance assessment. Here we present scores for 10 repetition of the process. fi_rf10 &lt;- replicate(10, feature_importance(explain_titanic_rf), simplify = FALSE) do.call(plot, fi_rf10) + ggtitle(&quot;Permutation based feature importance&quot;, &quot;For Random Forest model and Titanic data&quot;) Figure 14.2: Feature importance for 10 replication of feature importance assessment It is much easier to assess feature importance if they come with some assessment of the uncertainty. We can read from the plot that Age and passenger class are close to each other. Note that intervals are useful for model comparisons. In the Figure @ref{titanic5} we can read feature importance for random forest, gradient boosting and logistic regression models. Best results are achieved by the random forest model and also this method consume more features than others. A good example is the Fare variable, not used in gradient boosting not logistic regression (as a feature highly correlated with passenger class) but consumed in the random forest model. fi_rf &lt;- feature_importance(explain_titanic_rf) fi_gbm &lt;- feature_importance(explain_titanic_gbm) fi_glm &lt;- feature_importance(explain_titanic_lmr) plot(fi_rf, fi_gbm, fi_glm) Figure 14.3: Feature importance for random forest, gradient boosting and logistic regression models 14.3 Example: Price prediction Let’s create a regression model for prediction of apartment prices. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) set.seed(59) model_rf &lt;- randomForest(m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + no.rooms + district, data = apartments) A popular loss function for regression model is the root mean square loss \\[ L(x, y) = \\sqrt{\\frac1n \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2} \\] loss_root_mean_square( predict(model_rf, apartments), apartments$m2.price ) ## [1] 193.8477 Let’s calculate feature importance explainer_rf &lt;- explain(model_rf, data = apartmentsTest[,2:6], y = apartmentsTest$m2.price) vip &lt;- variable_importance(explainer_rf, loss_function = loss_root_mean_square) vip ## variable dropout_loss label ## 1 _full_model_ 285.1355 randomForest ## 2 no.rooms 391.0710 randomForest ## 3 construction.year 410.5866 randomForest ## 4 floor 445.2164 randomForest ## 5 surface 480.1431 randomForest ## 6 district 843.6519 randomForest ## 7 _baseline_ 1081.3710 randomForest On a diagnostic plot is useful to present feature importance as an interval that start in a loss and ends in a loss of perturbed data. plot(vip) 14.4 More models Much more can be read from feature importance plots if we compare models of a different structure. Let’s train three predictive models trained on apartments dataset from the DALEX package. Random Forest model (Breiman et al. 2018) (elastic but biased), Support Vector Machines model (Meyer et al. 2017) (large variance on boundaries) and Linear Model (stable but not very elastic). Presented examples are for regression (prediction of square meter price), but the CP profiles may be used in the same way for classification. Let’s fit these three models. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) model_lm &lt;- lm(m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + no.rooms + district, data = apartments) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) set.seed(59) model_rf &lt;- randomForest(m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + no.rooms + district, data = apartments) library(&quot;e1071&quot;) model_svm &lt;- svm(m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + no.rooms + district, data = apartments) For these models we use DALEX explainers created with explain() function. These explainers wrap models, predict functions and validation data. explainer_lm &lt;- explain(model_lm, data = apartmentsTest[,2:6], y = apartmentsTest$m2.price) vip_lm &lt;- variable_importance(explainer_lm, loss_function = loss_root_mean_square) vip_lm ## variable dropout_loss label ## 1 _full_model_ 282.0062 lm ## 2 construction.year 281.9007 lm ## 3 no.rooms 292.8398 lm ## 4 floor 492.0857 lm ## 5 surface 614.9198 lm ## 6 district 1002.3487 lm ## 7 _baseline_ 1193.6209 lm explainer_rf &lt;- explain(model_rf, data = apartmentsTest[,2:6], y = apartmentsTest$m2.price) vip_rf &lt;- variable_importance(explainer_rf, loss_function = loss_root_mean_square) vip_rf ## variable dropout_loss label ## 1 _full_model_ 293.2729 randomForest ## 2 no.rooms 389.4526 randomForest ## 3 construction.year 416.1154 randomForest ## 4 floor 453.9195 randomForest ## 5 surface 480.4062 randomForest ## 6 district 867.7050 randomForest ## 7 _baseline_ 1116.2616 randomForest explainer_svm &lt;- explain(model_svm, data = apartmentsTest[,2:6], y = apartmentsTest$m2.price) vip_svm &lt;- variable_importance(explainer_svm, loss_function = loss_root_mean_square) vip_svm ## variable dropout_loss label ## 1 _full_model_ 157.7938 svm ## 2 no.rooms 221.4595 svm ## 3 construction.year 365.2600 svm ## 4 floor 439.8724 svm ## 5 surface 527.2598 svm ## 6 district 942.8512 svm ## 7 _baseline_ 1203.7571 svm Let’s plot feature importance for all three models on a single plot. Intervals start in a different values, thus we can read that loss for SVM model is the lowest. When we compare other features it looks like in all models the district is the most important feature followed by surface and floor. plot(vip_rf, vip_svm, vip_lm) There is interesting difference between linear model and others in the way how important is the construction.year. For linear model this variable is not importance, while for remaining two models there is some importance. In the next chapter we will see how this is possible. 14.5 Level frequency What does the feature importance mean? How it is linked with a data distribution. References "],
["variableEngeneering.html", "Chapter 15 Feature effects 15.1 Global level vs instance level explanations", " Chapter 15 Feature effects In following chapters we introduce tools for extraction of the information between model response and individual model inputs. These tools are useful to summarize how ,,in general’’ model responds to the input of interest. All presented approaches are based on Ceteris Ceteris Paribus Profiles introduced in Chapter @ref{ceterisParibus} but they differ in a way how individual profiles are merged into a global model response. We use the term ,,feature effect’’ to refer to global model response as a function of single or small number of model features. Methods presented in this chapter are useful for extraction information of feature effect, i.e. how a feature is linked with model response. There are many possible applications of such methods, for example: Feature effect may be used for feature engineering. The crude approach to modeling is to fit some elastic model on raw data and then use feature effects to understand the relation between a raw feature and model output and then to transform model input to better fit the model output. Such procedure is called surrogate training. In this procedure an elastic model is trained to learn about link between a feature and the target. Then a new feature is created in a way to better utilized the feature in a simpler model (Gosiewska et al. 2019). In the next chapters we will show how feature effects can be used to transform a continuous variable in to a categorical one in order to improve the model behavior. Feature effect may be used for model validation. Understanding how a model utilizes a feature may be used as a validation of a model against domain knowledge. For example if we expect monotonic relation or linear relation then such expectations can be verified. Also if we expect smooth relation between model and its inputs then the smoothness can be visually examined. In the next chapters we will show how feature effects can be used to warn a model developer that model is unstable and should be regularized. In new domains an understanding of a link between model output and the feature of interest may increase our domain knowledge. It may give quick insights related to the strength or character of the relation between a feature of interest and the model output. The comparison of feature effects between different models may help to understand how different models handle particular features. In the next chapters we will show how feature effects can be used learn limitations of particular classes of models. 15.1 Global level vs instance level explanations The plot below shows Ceteris Paribus Profiles for the random forest rf_5 for 10 selected passengers. Different profiles behave differently. In following chapter we discuss different approaches to aggregation of such profiles into model level feature effects.

PDP were introduced by Friedman in 2000 in his paper devoted to Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) - new type of complex yet effective models (Friedman 2000). For many years PDP as sleeping beauties stay in the shadow of the boosting method. But this has changed in recent years. PDP are very popular and available in most of data science languages. In this chapter we will introduce key intuitions, explain the math beyond PDP and discuss strengths and weaknesses. General idea is to show how the expected model response behaves as a function of a selected feature. Here the term ,,expected’’ will be estimated simply as the average over the population of individual Ceteris Paribus Profiles introduced in 4. 16.1 Definition Partial Dependency Profile for for a model \\(f\\) and a variable \\(x^j\\) is defined as \\[ g_{PD}^{f, j}(z) = E[f(x^j=z, X^{-j})] = E[f(x|^j=z)]. \\] So it’s an expected value for \\(x^j = z\\) over marginal distribution \\(X^{-j}\\) or equivalently expected value of \\(f\\) after variable \\(x^j\\) is set to \\(z\\). Exercise Let \\(f = x_1 + x_2\\) and distribuion of \\((x_1, x_2)\\) is given by \\(x_1 \\sim U[0,1]\\) and \\(x_2=x_1\\). Calculate \\(g_{PD}^{f, 1}(z)\\). Answer \\(g_{PD}^{f, 1}(z) = z + 0.5\\). 16.2 Estimation Let’s see how they are constructed step by step. Here we will use a random forest rf_5 model for the titanic dataset. Examples are related to a single variable age. The expectation cannot be calculated directly as we do not know fully neither the distribution of \\(X^{-j}\\) nor the \\(f()\\). Yet this value may be estimated by as average from CP profiles. \\[ \\hat g_{PD}^{f, j}(z) = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i^j=z, x^{-j}_i)] = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i|^j=z). \\] Calculate Ceteris Paribus Profiles for observations from the dataset As it was introduced in @ref{ceterisParibus} Ceteris Paribus profiles are calculated for observations. They show how model response change is a selected variable in this observation is modified. \\[ CP^{f, j, x}(z) := f(x|^j = z). \\] Such profiles can be calculated for example with the ceteris_paribus{ingredients} function. (#fig:pdp_part_1)Ceteris Paribus profiles for 100 observations, the age variable and the random forest model So for a single model and a single variable we get a bunch of what-if profiles. In the figure @ref{pdp_part_1} we show an example for 100 observations. Despite some variation (random forest are not as stable as we would hope) we see that most profiles are decreasing. So the older the passengers is the lower is the survival probability. Aggregate Ceteris Paribus into a single Partial Dependency Profile Simple pointwise average across CP profiles. If number of CPprofiles is large, it is enoug to sample some number of them to get resonably accurate PD profiles. Here we show profiles calculated with ingredients package, but find siilar implementation in the pdp package (Greenwell 2017b), ALEPlots package (Apley 2018b) or iml (???) package. Such average can be calculated with the aggregate_profiles{ingredients} function. pdp_rf &lt;- aggregate_profiles(cp_rf) plot(pdp_rf) + ggtitle(&quot;Partial Dependency profile&quot;, &quot;For a random forest model / Titanic data&quot;) So for a single model and a single variable we get a profile. See an example in figure @ref{pdp_part_2}. It is much easier than following 100 separate curves, and in cases in which Ceteris Paribus are more or less parallel, the Partial Dependency is a good summary of them. The average response is of course more stable (as it’s an average) and in this case is more or less a decreasing curve. It’s much easier to notice that the older the passenger is the lower the survival probability. Moreover it is easier to notice that the largest drop in survival changes happen for teenagers. On average the survival for adults is 30 percent points smaller than for kids. (#fig:pdp_part_2)Partial Dependency profile as an average for 100 observations 16.3 Clustered Partial Dependency Profiles As we said in the previous section, Partial Dependency is a good summary if Ceteris Paribus profiles are similar, i.e. parallel. But it may happen that the variable of interest is in interaction with some other variable. Then profiles are not parallel because the effect of variable of interest depends on some other variables. So on one hand it would be good to summaries all this Ceteris Paribus profiles with smaller number of profiles. But on another hand a single aggregate may not be enough. To deal with this problem we propose to cluster Ceteris Paribus profiles and check how homogenous are these profiles. The most straightforward approach would be to use a method for clustering, like k-means algorithm or hierarchical clustering, and see how these cluster of profiles behave. Once clusters are established we can aggregate within clusters in the same way as in case of Partial Dependency Plots. Such clusters can be calculated with the cluster_profiles{ingredients} function. We choose the hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage as it gives most stable results. So for a single model and a single variable we get \\(k\\) profiles. The common problem in clustering is the selection of \\(k\\). However in our case, as it’s an exploration, the problem is simpler, as we are interesting if \\(k=1\\) (Partial Dependency is a good summary) or not (there are some interactions). See an example in Figure @ref{pdp_part_4}. It is easier to notice that Ceteris Paribus profiles can be groups in three clusters. Group of passengers with a very large drop in the survival (cluster 1), moderate drop (cluster 2) and almost no drop in survival (cluster 3). Here we do not know what other factors are linked with these clusters, but some additional exploratory analysis can be done to identify these factors. (#fig:pdp_part_4)Cluster profiles for 3 clusters over 100 Ceteris Paribus profiles 16.4 Grouped Partial Dependency Profiles Once we see that variable of interest may be in interaction with some other variable, it is tempting to look for the factor that distinguish clusters. The most straightforward approach is to use some other variable as a grouping variable. This can be done by setting the groups argument in the aggregate_profiles{ingredients} function. library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) selected_passangers &lt;- select_sample(titanic, n = 100) cp_rf &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_titanic_rf, selected_passangers) pdp_Sex_rf &lt;- aggregate_profiles(cp_rf, variables = &quot;age&quot;, groups = &quot;gender&quot;) See an example in Figure @ref{pdp_part_5}. Clearly there is an interaction between Age and Sex. The survival for woman is more stable, while for man there is more sudden drop in Survival for older passengers. Check how the interaction for Pclass (passenger class) looks like. (#fig:pdp_part_5)Grouped profiles with respect to the gender variable 16.5 Contrastive Model Comparisons Contrastive comparisons of Partial Dependency Plots are useful not only for subgroups of observations but also for model comparisons. Why one would like to compare models? There are at least three reasons for it. Agreement of models will calm us. Some models are known to be more stable other to be more elastic. If profiles for models from these two classes are not far from each other we can be more convinced that elastic model is not over-fitted. Disagreement of models helps to improve. If simpler interpretable model disagree with an elastic model, this may suggest a feature transformation that can be used to improve the interpretable model. For example if random forest learned non linear relation then it can be captures by a linear model after suitable transformation. Validation of boundary conditions. Some models are know to have different behavior on the boundary, for largest or lowest values. Random forest is known to shrink predictions towards the average, while support vector machines are known to have larger variance at edges. Contrastive comparisons may help to understand differences in boundary behavior. Generic plot{ingredients} function handles multiple models as consecutive arguments. See an example in Figure @ref{pdp_part_7}. Random forest is compared with gradient boosting model and generalized linear model (logistic regression). All three models agree when it comes to a general relation between Age and Survival. Logistic regression is of course the most smooth. Gradient boosting has on average higher predictions than random forest. (#fig:pdp_part_7)Comparison on three predictive models with different structures. References "],
["conditionalProfiles.html", "Chapter 17 Conditional Dependency Profiles 17.1 Definition 17.2 Estimation 17.3 Example", " Chapter 17 Conditional Dependency Profiles One of the largest advantages of the Partial Dependency Profiles is that they are easy to explain, as they are just an average across Ceteris Paribus profiles. But one of the largest disadvantages lies in expectation over marginal distribution which implies that \\(x^j\\) is independent from \\(x^{-j}\\). In many applications this assumption is violated. For example, for the apartments dataset one can expect that features like \\(surface\\) and \\(number.or.rooms\\) are strongly correlated as apartments with larger number of rooms usually have larger surface. It may makes no sense to consider an apartment with 10 rooms and 20 square meters, so it may be misleading to change \\(x^{surface}\\) independently from \\(x^{number.of.rooms}\\). In the titanic dataset we shall expect correlation between fare and passanger class as tickets in the 1st class are the most expensive. There are several attempts to fix this problem. Here we introduce Local Dependency Profiles presented in the (Apley 2018b) under the name M-profiles. The general idea is to use conditional distribution instead of marginal distribution to accomodate for the dependency between \\(x^j\\) and \\(x^{-j}\\). 17.1 Definition Conditional Dependency Profile for a model \\(f\\) and a variable \\(x^j\\) is defined as \\[ g_{CD}^{f, j}(z) = E[f(X^j, X^{-j})|X^j = z]. \\] So it’s an expected value over conditional distribution \\((X^j,X^{-j})|X^j=z\\). Exercise Let \\(f = x_1 + x_2\\) and distribuion of \\((x_1, x_2)\\) is given by \\(x_1 \\sim U[0,1]\\) and \\(x_2=x_1\\). Calculate \\(g_{CD}^{f, 1}(z)\\). Answer \\(g_{CD}^{f, 1}(z) = 2*z\\). 17.2 Estimation Partial Dependency Profiles are defined as an expected value from Ceteris Paribus Profiles. \\[ g^{PD}_i(z) = E_{X_{-i}}[ f(x|^i = z, x^{-i}) ]. \\] And can be estimated as average from CP profiles. \\[ \\hat g^{PD}_i(z) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(x|^i = z, x_j^{-i}). \\] As it was said, if \\(X_i\\) and \\(X_{-i}\\) are related it may have no sense to average CP profiles over marginal \\(X_{-i}\\). Instead, an intuitive approach would to use a conditional distribution \\(X_{-i}|X_i=x_i\\). \\[ g^{M}_i(z) = E_{X_{-i}|X_i=x_i}[ f(x|^i = z, x^{-i}) ]. \\] 17.3 Example See Figure ?? for illustration of difference between marginal and conditional distribution. Such profiles are called Conditional Dependency Profiles and are estimated as \\[ \\hat g^{M}_i(z) = \\frac{1}{|N_i|} \\sum_{j\\in N_i} f(x|^i = z, x_j^{-i}). \\] where \\(N_i\\) is the set of observations with \\(x_i\\) close to \\(z\\). Figure 17.1: (fig:accumulatedCor) As it is justified in (Apley 2018b), there is a serious problem with this approach, illustrated by a following observation. If \\(y\\) depends on \\(x_2\\) but not \\(x_1\\) then the correlation between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) will produce a false relation in the Marginal profiles for feature \\(x_1\\). This problem is also illustrated in the Figure ??. (#fig:mp_part_1)Conditional Dependency Profile for 100 observations References "],
["accumulatedLocalProfiles.html", "Chapter 18 Accumulated Local Profiles 18.1 Definition", " Chapter 18 Accumulated Local Profiles As we showed in the previous chapter, Conditional Dependency Profiles takes into account dependency between features, but it is both advantage and disadvantage. The advantage is that in some cases the dependency is real and should be taken into account when computing expected value of \\(f\\). The disadvantage is that in the Conditional Dependency Profiles we see both effects of the feature of interest \\(x^j\\) and other features that are dependent on it. Accumulated Local Profiles disentangle effects of a feature of interest and features correlated with it. For example, for the apartments dataset one can expect that features like \\(surface\\) and \\(number.or.rooms\\) are correlated but we can also imagine that each of these variables affect the apartment price somehow. Partial Dependency Profiles show how the average price changes as a function of surface, keeping all other variables unchanged. Conditional Dependency Profiles show how the average price changes as a function of surface adjusting all other variables to the current value of the surface. Accumulated Local Profiles show how the average price changes as a function of surface adjusting all other variables to the current value of the surface but extracting changes caused by these other features. Accumulated Local Dependency Profiles presented in the (Apley 2018b) paper. The general idea is to accumulate local changes in model response affected by single feature \\(x^j\\). 18.1 Definition Accumulated Local Profile for a model \\(f\\) and a variable \\(x^j\\) is defined as \\[ g_{AL}^{f, j}(z) = \\int_{z_0}^z E\\left[\\frac{\\partial f(X^j, X^{-j})}{\\partial x_j}|X^j = v\\right] dv + c, \\] where \\(z_0\\) if the lower boundry of \\(x^j\\). The profile \\(g_{AL}^{f, j}(z)\\) is calculated up to some constant \\(c\\). Usually the constant \\(c\\) is selected to keep average \\(g_{AL}^{f, j}\\) equal to 0 or average \\(f\\). The equation may be a bit complex, but the intuition is not that complicated. Instead of aggregation of Ceteris Paribus we just look locally how quickly CP profiles are changing. And AL profile is reconstructed from such local partial changes. So it’s an cummulated expected change of the model response along where the expected values are calculated over conditional distribution \\((X^j,X^{-j})|X^j=v\\). Exercise Let \\(f = x_1 + x_2\\) and distribuion of \\((x_1, x_2)\\) is given by \\(x_1 \\sim U[0,1]\\) and \\(x_2=x_1\\). Calculate \\(g_{AD}^{f, 1}(z)\\). Answer \\(g_{AD}^{f, 1}(z) = z\\).

The most popular techniques for validation (k-fold cross-validation, repeated cross-validation, and so on) test models on data with the same distribution as training data. Yet, in many practical applications, deployed models are working in a changing environment. After some time, due to changes in the environment, model performance may degenerate, as model may be less reliable. Concept drift refers to the change in the data distribution or in the relationships between variables over time. Think about model for energy consumption for a school, over time the school may be equipped with larger number of devices of with more power-efficient devices that may affect the model performance. In this chapter we define basic ideas behind concept drift and propose some solutions. 24.1 Introduction In general, concept drift means that some statistical properties of variables used in the model change over time. This may result in degenerated performance. Thus the early detection of concept drift is very important, as it is needed to adapt quickly to these changes. The term concept usually refers to target variable, but generally, it can also refer to model input of relations between variables. The most general formulation of a concept drift refers to changes in joint distribution of \\(p(X, y)\\). It is useful to define also following measures. Conditional Covariate Drift as change in \\(p(X | y)\\) Conditional Class Drift as change in \\(p(y | X)\\) Covariate Drift or Concept Shift as changes in \\(p(X)\\) Once the drift is detected one may re-fit the model on newer data or update the model. 24.2 Covariate Drift Covariate Drift is a change in distribution of input, change in the distribution of \\(p(X)\\). The input is a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector with variables of possible mixed types and distributions. Here we propose a simple one-dimensional method, that can be applied to each variable separately despite of its type. We do not rely on any formal statistical test, as the power of the test depends on sample size and for large samples the test will detect even small differences. We also consider an use-case for two samples. One sample gathers historical ,,old’’ data, this may be data available during the model development (part of it may be used as training and part as test data). Second sample is the current ,,new’’ data, and we want to know is the distribution of \\(X_{old}\\) differs from the distribution of \\(X_{new}\\). There is a lot of distances between probability measures that can be used here (as for example Wasserstein, Total Variation and so on). We are using the Non-Intersection Distance due to its easy interpretation. For categorical variables \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) non-intersection distance is defined as \\[ d(P,Q) = 1 - \\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal X} \\min(p_i, q_i) \\] where \\(\\mathcal X\\) is a set of all possible values while \\(p_i\\) and \\(q_i\\) are probabilities for these values in distribution \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) respectively. An intuition behind this distance is that it’s amount of the distribution \\(P\\) that is not shared with \\(Q\\) (it’s symmetric). The smaller the value the closes are these distributions. For continuous variables we discretize their distribution in the spirit of \\(\\chi^2\\) test. 24.3 Code snippets Here we are going to use the drifter package that implements some tools for concept drift detection. As an illustration we use two datasets from the DALEX2 package, namely apartments (here we do not have drift) and dragons (here we do have drift). library(&quot;DALEX2&quot;) library(&quot;drifter&quot;) # here we do not have any drift head(apartments, 2) ## m2.price construction.year surface floor no.rooms district ## 1 5897 1953 25 3 1 Srodmiescie ## 2 1818 1992 143 9 5 Bielany d &lt;- calculate_covariate_drift(apartments, apartments_test) d ## Variable Shift ## ------------------------------------- ## m2.price 4.9 ## construction.year 6.0 ## surface 6.8 ## floor 4.9 ## no.rooms 2.8 ## district 2.8 # here we do have drift head(dragons, 2) ## year_of_birth height weight scars colour year_of_discovery ## 1 -1291 59.40365 15.32391 7 red 1700 ## 2 1589 46.21374 11.80819 5 red 1700 ## number_of_lost_teeth life_length ## 1 25 1368.433 ## 2 28 1377.047 d &lt;- calculate_covariate_drift(dragons, dragons_test) d ## Variable Shift ## ------------------------------------- ## year_of_birth 8.9 ## height 15.3 . ## weight 14.7 . ## scars 4.6 ## colour 17.9 . ## year_of_discovery 97.5 *** ## number_of_lost_teeth 6.3 ## life_length 8.6 24.4 Residual Drift Perhaps the most obvious negative effect of the concept drift is that the model performance degrades over time. But this is also something that is straightforward to verify. One can calculate distribution of residuals on new data and compare this distribution with residuals obtained on old data. Again, we have two samples, residuals calculated on the old dataset \\[ r_{old} = y_{old} - \\hat y_{old} = y_{old} - f_{old}(X_{old}) \\] versus residuals calculated on the new dataset \\[ r_{new} = y_{new} - \\hat y_{new} = y_{new} - f_{old}(X_{new}) \\] We can use any distance between distributions to compare \\(r_{new}\\) and \\(r_{old}\\), for example the non-intersection distance. 24.5 Code snippets Here we are going to use the drifter package. library(&quot;DALEX2&quot;) library(&quot;drifter&quot;) library(&quot;ranger&quot;) data_old &lt;- apartments_test[1:4000,] data_new &lt;- apartments_test[4001:8000,] predict_function &lt;- function(m,x,...) predict(m, x, ...)$predictions model_old &lt;- ranger(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments) calculate_residuals_drift(model_old, data_old, data_new, data_old$m2.price, data_new$m2.price, predict_function = predict_function) ## Variable Shift ## ------------------------------------- ## Residuals 3.6 24.6 Model Drift Model Drift is a change in the relation between target variable and input variables, change in \\(p(y|X)\\). The input is a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector with variables of possible mixed types and distributions. Here we propose a simple one-dimensional method based on Partial Dependency Plots introduced in the Chapter ??. PDP profiles summaries marginal relation between \\(\\hat y\\) and variable \\(x_i\\). The idea behind concept drift is to compare two models, the old model \\(f_{old}\\) and model refitted on the new data \\(f_{new}\\) and compare these models through PDP profiles. For each variable we can obtain scores for drift calculated as \\(L_2\\) distance between PDP profiles for both models. \\[ drift_{i} = \\frac 1 {|Z_i|}\\int_{z\\in Z_i} (PDP_i(f_{old}) - PDP_i(f_{new}))^2 dz \\] where \\(Z_i\\) is the set of values for variable \\(x_i\\) (for simplicity we assume that it’s an interval) while \\(PDP_i(f_{new})\\) is the PDP profile for variable \\(i\\) calculated for the model \\(f_{new}\\). 24.7 Code snippets Here we are going to use the drifter package.
